## The Motive
+ I couldn't find a Quran Vault that is searchable and linkable to my other notes. I either had to install a plugin or go to the Ayah folder to be able to link it, and this requires me to know which Surah and the number of Ayah to be able to pull it to my note. SO HERE YOU ARE.

## Features
1. Searchable quran text.
2. linking ability between your notes and the Quran Ayah.
3. NO PLUGINS NEEDED.

## The Maneual
#### 3 folders hirerarchy:
1. Ayat - آيات القرآن
2. Surahs - سور القرآن
3. Juz - أجزاء القرآن

#### 5 Blocks Inside of an Ayah note:
inside of an Ayah note you will find 5 blocks:
1. Arabic Ayah Drawing in ottoman font.
2. Arabic Ayah text.
3. English Ayah Transilation.
4. English Ayah Notes
5. Linked Juz and Surah which Ayah belongs to, so you don't have to google it.

#### You can link the whole Ayah note, or you can choose which block to link.
you can do this by adding '!' before the double linking brackets, and add '^' after ayah name.
