## The Motive
+ I couldn't find a Quran Vault that is searchable and linkable to my other notes. I either had to install a plugin or go to the Ayah folder to be able to link it, and this requires me to know which Surah and the number of Ayah to be able to pull it to my note. SO HERE YOU ARE.
+ 
## Features
1. Searchable quran text.
2. linking ability between your notes and the Quran Ayah.
3. NO PLUGINS NEEDED.

## The Maneual
#### Folders Hierarchy
You have three folders:
1. Ayat - آيات القرآن
  + organized in folders by Surah
3. Surahs - سور القرآن
4. Juz - أجزاء القرآن
