2,1,2,"All praise be to Allah[1], the Lord[2] of the worlds[3],","[1] Allah is God’s most unique name.
 [2] The Arabic term ""rabb"" (translated as ""Lord"") includes all of the following meanings: ""owner, master, ruler, controller, sustainer, provider, guardian and caretaker.""
 [3] ""the worlds"" means mankind, jinn, and all that exists."
3,1,3,"the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful[4],","[4] Ar-Rahmān and Ar-Raheem are two names of Allah: Rahmān is used only to describe Allah, while raheem might be used to describe a human as well. Rahmān carries a wider meaning - merciful to all creation. Justice is a part of this mercy. Raheem includes the concept of specialty - especially merciful to the believers. Forgiveness is a part of this mercy. In addition, Rahmān is adjectival, referring to an attribute of Allah and is part of His essence. Raheem is verbal, indicating what He does: i.e., bestowing and implementing mercy."
4,1,4,Master[5] of the Day of Judgment.,"[5] Other meanings for ""Mālik"": Sovereign, Owner, etc."
5,1,5,"You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help.",
6,1,6,"Guide us to the straight path,",
7,1,7,"the path of those whom You have blessed[6]; not of those who incurred Your Wrath[7], or of those who went astray[8].","[6] The way of the Prophets and those who follow them.
 [7] Those who know the Truth and do not follow it, like the Jews.
 [8] Those who are ignorant of the Truth and follow misguidance, like the Christians."
8,2,1,Alif Lām Mīm[1].,[1] Allah knows the meaning of these disjointed Arabic letters. This bears testimony to the inimitable nature of the Qur’an and its divine source.
9,2,2,"This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for the righteous[2],","[2] Literally, ""those who have taqwā,"" i.e., who have piety, righteousness, fear and love of Allah, and who take great care of avoiding His displeasure."
10,2,3,"those who believe in the unseen, establish prayer[3], and spend out of what We[4] have provided for them,","[3] At its proper times and fulfill its all conditions. [4] ""We"" in reference to Allah in the Qur’anic verses is necessarily understood to denote grandeur and power."
11,2,4,"and those who believe in what has been sent down to you [O Prophet] and in what was sent down before you[5], and in the Hereafter they believe with certainty.","[5] i.e., the Taurāt (Torah) and the Injīl (Gospel), etc."
12,2,5,"It is they who are upon guidance from their Lord, and it is they who are successful.",
13,2,6,"Those who persist in disbelief, it is the same whether you warn them or not, they will not believe.",
14,2,7,"Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing, and their sight is covered[6]; and for them there will be a great punishment.","[6] A covering preventing from discerning guidance, as a result of their arrogance and persistence in sin."
15,2,8,"There are some people[7] who say, “We believe in Allah and the Last Day,” whereas they are not believers.","[7] i.e., the hypocrites."
16,2,9,"They seek to deceive Allah and those who believe, while they deceive none but themselves, but they do not realize.",
17,2,10,"In their hearts is a sickness[8], and Allah increased their sickness, and they will have a painful punishment for their persistent lying.","[8] The ""sickness"" mentioned here includes doubt, hypocrisy, arrogance and disbelief."
18,2,11,"When it is said to them, “Do not spread corruption in the land,” they say, “We are only reformers.”",
19,2,12,"Indeed, it is they who spread corruption, but they do not realize it.",
20,2,13,"When it is said to them, “Believe as the people have believed,” they say, “Shall we believe as the fools[9] have believed?” Indeed, it is they who are the fools, but they do not know.","[9] The hypocrites were considering the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) to be fools, whereas they themselves were fools."
21,2,14,"When they meet those who believe, they say, “We believe.” But when they are alone with their evil ones[10], they say, “We are certainly with you; we were only mocking.”","[10] i.e., their leaders in evil and disbelief."
22,2,15,Allah will mock them[11] and prolong them to wander blindly in their transgression.,[11] Allah mocks them in response to their mocking Muslims.
23,2,16,"They are those who purchased misguidance for guidance, but their trade was profitless, and they were not guided.",
24,2,17,"Their likeness is that of someone who kindles a fire. When it illuminates all around him, Allah takes away their light, leaving them in utter darkness, unable to see[12].","[12] This is the situation of the hypocrites in the darkness of doubt and disbelief, not seeing the truth and guidance."
25,2,18,"Deaf, dumb, and blind; they will not return [to the straight path].",
26,2,19,"Or like a downpour from the sky accompanied by darkness, thunder, and lightning. They put their fingers into their ears out of thunderclaps, for fear of death. But Allah encompasses the disbelievers.",
27,2,20,"The lightning almost snatches away their eyesight. Every time lightning[13] strikes, they walk in its light, but when it becomes dark, they stand still. If Allah had willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight; for Allah is Most Capable of all things.",[13] The parable of lightning is that of the light of the Qur’an.
28,2,21,"O people, worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, so that you may become righteous;",
29,2,22,"He Who made the earth a resting place for you, and the sky a canopy; and sends down rain from the sky, and brings forth fruits thereby as a provision for you. So do not set up rivals to Allah while you know[14].","[14] Do not set up rivals to Allah (in worship), Who has provided you with all these things, and you know that He alone is worthy of worship."
30,2,23,"If you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down upon Our slave[15], then produce a chapter like it and call upon your helpers other than Allah, if you are truthful.",[15] “Our servant” is referring to Muhammad (ﷺ).
31,2,24,"But if you did not do it, and you can never do it; then beware of the Fire whose fuel will be people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.",
32,2,25,"And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens under which rivers flow. Every time they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” for they will be given fruit that resemble one another. They will have purified spouses, and they will abide therein forever.",
33,2,26,"Allah is not ashamed to give a similitude of a mosquito or even something less [significant][16]. As for those who believe, they know that this is the truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve say, “What does Allah mean by this similitude?” He causes many to go astray thereby and guides many thereby, but He causes none to go astray except the evildoers –","[16] Lit., ""above it"" i.e., greater in smallness."
34,2,27,"those who break the covenant of Allah after it has been ratified, sever bonds that Allah has commanded to be maintained[17], and spread corruption in the land. It is they who are the losers.",[17] By keeping good relations with kith and kin.
35,2,28,"How can you disbelieve in Allah, when you were lifeless then He gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you back to life again, then to Him you will be returned?",
36,2,29,"It is He Who created for you all that is in the earth, then He turned towards the heaven and made them seven heavens, and He is All-Knowing of everything.",
37,2,30,"And [remember] when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to appoint a vicegerent on earth.” They said, “Will You appoint on it someone who will spread corruption therein and shed blood, while we glorify You with Your praises and proclaim Your holiness?” He said, “I know that which you do not know.”",
38,2,31,"And He taught Adam the names of everything; then He presented them to the angels, and said, “Tell Me the names of these, if what you say is true?”",
39,2,32,"They said, “Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You Who are the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”",
40,2,33,"He said, “O Adam, inform them of their names.” When he informed them of their names, Allah said, “Did I not tell you that I know the unseen of the heavens and earth, and I know what you reveal and what you conceal?”",
41,2,34,"And when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam[18],” and they prostrated except Iblīs[19]; he refused and was arrogant, and was one of the disbelievers.","[18] This prostration was done in obedience to Allah, out of respect, not worship.
 [19] The proper name of Satan, who was not an angel, but from the jinn."
42,2,35,"We said, “O Adam, dwell in Paradise, you and your wife; and eat pleasantly from wherever you wish, but do not approach this tree, or else you will both become the wrongdoers.”",
43,2,36,"Then Satan tempted them and drove them out of the state they were in, and We said, “Go down [to the earth], as enemies to one another. You will have abode on earth and provision for an appointed time[20].”",[20] Until the Day of Judgment.
44,2,37,"Then Adam received some words[21] from his Lord, and He accepted his repentance. He is the Accepter of repentance, the Most Merciful.","[21] These words, or supplications are: “They [both] said: “Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers.” See 7:23."
45,2,38,"We said, “Go down all of you from here[22]! Then when My guidance comes to you; whoever follows My guidance, will have no fear, nor will they grieve.","[22] The addressees were Adam, Eve and Satan."
46,2,39,"But those who disbelieve and reject Our signs, they are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.”",
47,2,40,"O Children of Israel[23], remember My favor that I bestowed upon you, and fulfill My covenant; I will fulfill your covenant[24], and fear none but Me.","[23] Israel is Prophet Jacob (عليه السلام). The use of the epithet ‘Children of Israel’ for the Israelites is to remind them to follow their ancestor from whom they are descended.
 [24] This mutual pledge is as follows: If the Children of Israel keep up the prayer, give zakah, believe in and support the prophets, and spend in the cause of Allah, Allah will, in return, expiate their sins and admit them to the Gardens under which rivers flow, i.e., Paradise."
48,2,41,"And believe in what I have sent down[25] which confirms that [Scripture] which is with you, and do not be the first to disbelieve in it, nor trade my verses for a small price, and fear Me alone.","[25] i.e., the prophethood of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), which is mentioned in the Torah."
49,2,42,"And do not mix the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth knowingly[26].",[26] The prophethood of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ).
50,2,43,"And establish prayer, give zakah, and bow [to Allah] with those who bow[27].","[27] This command is to the Children of Israel to bow down in obedience to Allah with Muhammad, as the Muslims do, i.e., embrace Islam."
51,2,44,"Do you enjoin righteousness upon people while you forget yourselves, even though you recite the Scripture[28]? Do you not understand?","[28] i.e., the Torah."
52,2,45,"Seek help through patience and prayer. It is strenuous except for the humble,",
53,2,46,"those who are sure that they are going to meet their Lord, and that they will return to Him.",
54,2,47,"O Children of Israel, remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you and that I favored you over all other people[29].","[29] In their time, Allah favored them with certain privileges over other people such as sending them prophets and divine Books, and giving them kingship."
55,2,48,"And fear a Day when no soul will avail another anything, nor intercession will be accepted, nor compensation taken, nor will they be helped.",
56,2,49,"And [remember] when We saved you from Pharaoh’s people, who were inflicting dreadful torment upon you: slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. That was a great trial from your Lord.",
57,2,50,"And [remember] when We parted the sea for you and saved you, while We drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on.",
58,2,51,"And [remember] when We appointed for Moses forty nights. Then you took the calf [for worship] in his absence, while you were wrongdoers.",
59,2,52,"Yet We pardoned you after that, so that you may be grateful.",
60,2,53,"And [remember] when We gave Moses the Scripture and the criterion[30], so that you may be guided.","[30] Differentiating between truth and falsehood. ""The Scripture and the criterion"" refers to the Torah."
61,2,54,"And [remember] when Moses said to his people, “O my people, you have wronged yourselves by taking the calf [for worship]. So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves [i.e., the guilty among you]; that is best for you with your Creator.” Then He accepted your repentance, for He is the Accepter of Repentance, the Most Merciful.",
62,2,55,"And [remember] when you said, “O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah openly,” so a thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on.",
63,2,56,"Then We raised you back to life after your death, so that you may be grateful.",
64,2,57,"And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails[31], [saying], “Eat of the good things We have provided for you.” They did not wrong Us, but they wronged themselves.","[31] They both have linguistic roots in Arabic; ""al-mann"" means that which is God-given without effort, while ""al-salwā"" means that in which one finds consolation and comfort."
65,2,58,"And [remember] when We said, “Enter this town [of Jerusalem] and eat freely from wherever you wish, and enter the gate bowing down humbly and say, ‘Absolve us[32].’ We will forgive you your sins and increase [the reward of] those who do good.”",[32] In gratitude to Allah and admission of sin.
66,2,59,But the wrongdoers changed the words to other than what they were told[33]; so We sent down upon the wrongdoers a torment from the heaven for their rebelliousness.,"[33] They were asked to seek forgiveness. The word is hittah, which means: to put down a burden, but they twisted their tongues to mean ‘barley’, hintah."
67,2,60,"And [remember] when Moses asked for water for his people, and We said, “Strike the rock with your staff,” Then twelve springs gushed forth from it; each tribe knew its drinking place[34]. “Eat and drink from Allah’s provision, and do not spread corruption in the land.”","[34] The twelve tribes of the Children of Israel, who are called ""Asbāt""."
68,2,61,"And [remember] when you said, “O Moses, we cannot bear the same meal. So call upon your Lord to bring forth for us from what the earth produces – its herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions.” Moses said, “Would you exchange what is better for what is inferior? Go down to any town and you will have what you have asked for.” They were struck with humiliation and destitution, and incurred the wrath of Allah. That was because they used to reject the signs of Allah and kill the prophets unjustly. That was because they disobeyed and were transgressors.",
69,2,62,"The believers and those who were Jews, Christians, and the Sabians [before Prophet Muhammad] – whoever believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteous deed, they will have their reward with their Lord, and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.",
70,2,63,"And [remember] when We took your covenant [O Children of Israel] and raised above you the mountain [saying], “Hold firmly to what We have given you and observe its teachings, so that you may become righteous.”",
71,2,64,"But then you turned away after that. If it had not been for the grace and mercy of Allah upon you, you would have surely been among the losers.",
72,2,65,"And you know about those among you who broke the Sabbath, whereupon We said to them, “Be apes, despised.”",
73,2,66,"So We made it a deterrent punishment for those alive and for those who succeeded them, and an admonition for the righteous.",
74,2,67,"And [remember] when Moses said to his people, “Allah commands you to slaughter a cow.” They said, “Are you mocking us?” Moses said, “I seek refuge in Allah from being among the ignorant!”",
75,2,68,"They said, “Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what [type of cow] it is.” He said, “Allah says, ‘It is a cow that is neither too old nor too young, but somewhere in between. So do as you are commanded!’”",
76,2,69,"They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us its color.” He said, “Allah says, ‘It is a yellow cow, bright in color – pleasing to the beholders.’”",
77,2,70,"They again said, “Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. All cows look alike to us. If Allah wills, we will surely be guided.”",
78,2,71,"He said, “Allah says, ‘It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor water the field; sound, without blemish.’” They said, “Now you have come with the truth.” Then they slaughtered it, although they were almost not doing it.",
79,2,72,"And [remember] when you [Israelites] slew a man and disputed as to who the killer was, but Allah exposed what you were concealing.",
80,2,73,"We said, “Strike the slain with a piece of it.” This is how Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His signs, so that you may understand.",
81,2,74,"Then your hearts became hardened after that, like rocks or even harder. There are rocks from which rivers gush forth, and there are others that split open from which water comes out, while others fall down out of humility to Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.",
82,2,75,"Do you [O believers] hope that they would respond to your call to believe, while a party of them used to hear the word of Allah[35] then distort it knowingly after understanding it?","[35] i.e., the Torah."
83,2,76,"And when they meet the believers they say, “We believe.” But when they[36] meet one another in private they say, “Are you telling them what Allah has revealed to you [about Mohammad], so that they may argue against you before your Lord? Have you no sense?”","[36] i.e., the Jews."
84,2,77,Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal?,
85,2,78,"And among them, there are illiterate people, who know nothing of the Scripture except wishful thinking, and they do nothing but guesswork.",
86,2,79,"So woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands, and then say, “This is from Allah,” in order to trade it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn.",
87,2,80,"And they say, “The Fire will never touch us except for a few days.” Say, “Have you taken a covenant from Allah; for Allah will never break His covenant, or are you saying about Allah what you do not know?”",
88,2,81,No indeed! Those who do evil and are surrounded by their sins – they are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.,
89,2,82,But those who believe and do righteous deeds – they are the people of Paradise; they will abide therein forever.,
90,2,83,"And [remember] when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, “Do not worship except Allah; be kind to parents and kindred, and to orphans and those in need; speak good words to people; establish prayer; and give Zakah.” But then you turned away paying no heed, except a few of you.",
91,2,84,"And [remember] when We took a covenant from you that you should neither shed blood of one another, nor expel one another from your homes. Then you acknowledged it, while bearing and you bear witness to it.",
92,2,85,"Then here you are, killing one another and expelling a group of your people from their homes, aiding one another against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their expulsion was forbidden to you[37]. Do you then believe in part of the Scripture and deny another part? Then what is the recompense for those who do so among you except disgrace in this life, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be subjected to the severest torment? For Allah is not unaware of what you do.","[37] There were three Jewish tribes who allied themselves with the two Arab tribes of Madinah before Islam: Banū Qaynuqā‘, Banū an-Nadīr and Banū Qurayzah. In their prolonged feuds, the Jewish clans fought alongside their allies against their brethren."
93,2,86,"These are the people who have purchased the life of this world for the Hereafter; their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.",
94,2,87,"We gave Moses the Scripture and sent a succession of messengers after him. We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear signs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit[38]. Is it that every time a messenger comes to you [O Israelites] with something against your desires, you become arrogant; some of them you rejected, and others you killed?","[38] i.e., the Angel Gabriel (عليه السلام)."
95,2,88,"They say, “Our hearts are wrapped.” Nay, Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, little is it that they believe.",
96,2,89,"Now that there has come to them a Book from Allah[39], confirming that which is with them[40] – although they used to pray for victory over the disbelievers in the past. But when there came to them what they recognize [to be true], they rejected it. May the curse of Allah be upon the disbelievers!","[39] i.e., the Qur’an.
 [40] i.e., the Jews."
97,2,90,"How miserable is the price for which they sold their souls – disbelieving in Allah’s revelation out of jealous hatred that Allah would send down His grace to whom He wills of His slaves! Thus they have incurred wrath upon wrath[41], and for the disbelievers, there will be a disgracing punishment.",[41] They deserved double wrath: firstly for their earlier rebelliousness and then for denying Muhammad (ﷺ).
98,2,91,"When it is said to them, “Believe in what Allah has sent down[42],” they say, “We only believe in what was sent down to us[43],” and they deny what came afterwards, although it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, “Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you were truly believers?”","[42] i.e., the Qur’an. [43] i.e., the Torah."
99,2,92,"Moses came to you with clear signs, yet you took the calf [for worship] in his absence, while you were wrongdoers.",
100,2,93,"And [remember] when We took a covenant from you and We raised above you the mountain [saying], “Hold firmly to what We have given you and obey,” they said, “We hear and disobey.” The love of [worshiping] the calf was engraved in their hearts because of their disbelief. Say, “How wretched is what your faith enjoins you, if you are believers!”",
101,2,94,"Say, “If the Home of the Hereafter with Allah is only for you [O Israelites] among all humans, then wish for death, if you are truthful.”",
102,2,95,But they will never wish for that because of what their hands have sent forth. And Allah is All-Knowing of the wrongdoers.,
103,2,96,"And you will surely find them the most greedy people for life, even more than the polytheists. Each one of them wishes to have a life of a thousand years. Even if they were granted such a long life, it would not save them from the punishment; for Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.",
104,2,97,"Say [O Prophet], “Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel – it is he who brings down this [Qur’an] to your heart by Allah’s permission, confirming what came before it, and a guidance and glad tidings for the believers.”",
105,2,98,"Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and messengers, and to Gabriel and Michael – then Allah is indeed an enemy to the disbelievers.",
106,2,99,"We have sent down to you clear proofs, and none will reject them except the evildoers.",
107,2,100,"Is it that every time they ratify a covenant, a party of them cast it aside? In fact, most of them do not believe.",
108,2,101,"And when a messenger[44] from Allah came to them – confirming what was with them, a party of the People of the Book cast Allah’s Scripture behind their backs as if they did not know.","[44] i.e., Muhammad (ﷺ)."
109,2,102,"They followed what was recited by the devils during the kingdom of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels Hārūt and Mārūt in Babylon. But these two angels did not teach anyone without telling them, “We are only a test, so do not disbelieve.” Yet they would learn from them what would cause separation between a man and his wife. But they could not harm anyone except by Allah’s permission. They would learn what harmed them and did not benefit them, although they already knew that whoever gets into it would not have any share in the Hereafter. How terrible was the price for which they sold themselves, if only they knew!",
110,2,103,"If only they had believed and feared Allah, they would have had a better reward from Allah, if only they knew!",
111,2,104,"O you who believe, do not say, “Rā‘inā,” [i.e., consider our situation!] But say, “Unzhurnā,” [i.e., wait for us!] and listen. And for the disbelievers there will be a painful torment.",
112,2,105,"Neither those who disbelieved from the People of the Book nor the polytheists wish that your Lord sends down any good to you [O Muslims]. But Allah chooses for His mercy whom He wills, for Allah is the possessor of great bounty.",
113,2,106,We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring a better one or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is Most Capable of all things?,
114,2,107,"Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth, and that you have no protector or supporter besides Allah?",
115,2,108,Or would you like to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned before? Whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has indeed strayed from the sound path.,
116,2,109,"Many of the people of the Book wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of the envy in their hearts, after the truth has become evident to them. But pardon and overlook until Allah passes His decree[45], for Allah is Most Capable of all things.","[45] The provision of this verse has been abrogated, as Allah passed His decree."
117,2,110,"And establish prayer and give zakah. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, for Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.",
118,2,111,"And they say, “None will enter Paradise except a Jew or a Christian.” That is their wishful thinking. Say, “Produce your proof, if you are truthful.”",
119,2,112,"On the contrary, whoever submits himself to Allah and is a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. They will have no fear, nor will they grieve.",
120,2,113,"The Jews say, “The Christians have nothing to stand on” and the Christians say, “The Jews have nothing to stand on[46],” although they both recite the Scripture. And those [pagans] who have no knowledge say something similar. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.","[46] This incident is documented when the Christians of Najrān came to the Messenger of Allah, the rabbis met them and both parties disputed."
121,2,114,Who does greater wrong than the one who prevents Allah’s name to be mentioned in His mosques and strives for their destruction? Such people do not deserve to enter them except in fear[47]. There is a disgrace for them in this world and a great punishment in the Hereafter.,[47] Fear of divine justice or the believers will seize them.
122,2,115,"To Allah belong the east and the west; wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah[48]. For Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.","[48] i.e., the direction of prayer (Qiblah). This is by way of consolation to the believers that one can find Allah wherever one turns in case of mistake, or prayer of those who prayed to the direction of Jerusalem, etc."
123,2,116,"They say, “Allah has taken a son[49]”. Glory be to Him! Rather, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and earth – all are devoutly obedient to Him.","[49] The Jews claimed that Ezra was the son of God, the Christians claimed that Jesus was the son of God, and the Arab pagans claimed that the angels were God’s daughters."
124,2,117,"The Originator of the heavens and earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, “Be,” and it is.",
125,2,118,"Those who have no knowledge[50] say, “If only Allah would speak to us or a sign be given to us.” Those who came before them said similar words. Their hearts are all alike.

127,2,120,"The Jews and the Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their religion. Say, “The guidance of Allah is the [true] guidance.” If you were to follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, then you would have no protector or helper against Allah.",
128,2,121,"Those to whom We have given the Book recite it as it should be recited, it is they who believe in it. As for those who disbelieve in it, it is they who are the losers.",
129,2,122,"O Children of Israel, remember My blessings that I bestowed upon you, and that I favored you over all other people.",
130,2,123,"And beware of the Day when no one will avail another in any way; no compensation will be accepted, and no intercession will benefit it, nor will they be helped.",
131,2,124,"And [remember] when Abraham was tested by his Lord with certain words, which he fulfilled[51]. Allah said, “I will make you a leader for mankind.” He said, “And from among my descendants?” Allah said, “My covenant does not include the wrongdoers.”","[51] Allah assigned some tasks and commandments for Abraham (عليه السلام) to carry out, which he fulfilled dutifully."
132,2,125,"And [remember] when We made the House [i.e., Ka‘bah] a focal point and a sanctuary for the people. “[O believers], take the Station of Abraham as a place for prayer.” We charged Abraham and Ishmael to purify My House for those who perform circumambulation[52] or stay for worship, or those who bow down and prostrate.",[52] A form of worship particular to the Ka‘bah consisting of going around it in circuits.
133,2,126,"And [remember] when Abraham said, “My Lord, make this city [of Makkah] a sanctuary and provide its people with fruits – those among them who believe in Allah and the Last Day.” [Allah] said, “As for those who disbelieve, I will grant them enjoyment for a short while, then I will force them into the punishment of the Fire. What a terrible destination!”",
134,2,127,"And [remember] when Abraham was raising the foundations of the House and Ishmael, [saying], “Our Lord, accept this from us, for You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",
135,2,128,"Our Lord, make us both submitted to You and from our descendants a nation submitted to You; and show us our rituals[53] and accept our repentance. You are the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.",[53] The rituals of Hajj and ‘Umrah.

137,2,130,"Who would forsake the religion of Abraham[55] except a fool! We have chosen him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.","[55] The ‘religion of Abraham’, known as hanīfiyyah, is the most primordial, pristine and uncorrupted of all divine religions. The Qur’an underlines Islam’s close relation to it in various places."
138,2,131,"When his Lord said to him, “Submit[56],” he said, “I have submitted to the Lord of the worlds.”","[56] The meaning of the word ""Islam"" is ""submission to the will of Allah."" This is ordained by Allah and taught by all of the prophets from Adam to Muhammad (ﷺ). A Muslim is one who submits himself to Allah."
139,2,132,"This was enjoined by Abraham and Jacob to their offspring, “O my children, Allah has chosen for you this religion; so do not die except as Muslims.”",
140,2,133,"Or were you present when death approached Jacob, when he said to his children, “What will you worship after me”? They said, “We will worship your God and the God of your fathers – Abraham, Ishmael[57], and Isaac – the One God. And to Him we submit.”",[57] Ishmael was actually Jacob’s paternal uncle. They counted him among Jacob’s ‘fathers’ out of respect.

142,2,135,"They say, “Be Jews or Christians to be guided.” Say, “Rather [we follow] the religion of Abraham, the monotheist, and he was not one of the polytheists[58].”","[58] i.e., those who associate others with Allah in worship."
143,2,136,"Say [O believers], “We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us; and what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the descendants [of Jacob][59]; and what was given to Moses and Jesus; and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted.”","[59] i.e., the twelve tribes of Israel descended from Jacob."
144,2,137,"If they believe as you have believed, then they are guided. But if they turn away, then they are in plain dissension. Allah will suffice you against them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",
145,2,138,This is the natural religion[60] of Allah. Who is better than Allah in [enjoining a] religion? And it is He Whom we worship.,[60] “Sibghah” linguistically means ‘color’. It is so called because religious devoutness shows on the person as much as a dye of cloth shows on it.
146,2,139,"Say, “Do you [People of the Book] argue with us concerning Allah, when He is our Lord and your Lord? We are responsible for our deeds and you for yours, and we are sincerely devoted to Him.",
147,2,140,"Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the descendants [of Jacob] were Jews or Christians?” Say, “Are you more knowledgeable or Allah?” Who does greater wrong than the one who hides a testimony he has from Allah? But Allah is not unaware of what you do.",

149,2,142,The foolish among the people will say: “What has turned them away from their prayer direction they used to face[61]?” Say: “To Allah belong the east and west: He guides whom He wills to a straight path.”,"[61] Prior to the command (in verse 144) that the Prophet (ﷺ) and his followers turn toward the Ka‘bah in Makkah for prayer, they had been facing Jerusalem to the north. Further details are mentioned in succeeding verses."
150,2,143,"Thus We made you a balanced nation, so that you may be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger a witness over you. We did not change your former direction of prayer [to the Ka‘bah] except to distinguish those who would follow the Messenger from those who would turn back on their heels. It was surely burdensome except for those whom Allah guided. Allah would never let your [acts of] faith go to waste, for Allah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful to all people.",
151,2,144,"We see the turning of your face [O Prophet] towards heaven[62]; We will surely make you turn towards a prayer direction that will please you. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque [in Makkah], and wherever you are, turn your faces towards it. Those who were given the Scripture know that this is the truth from their Lord, and Allah is not unaware of what they do.",[62] The Prophet (ﷺ) was awaiting the command to change the qiblah; so he used to look up at the sky.
152,2,145,"Even if you were to bring every proof to those who have been given the Scripture, they would not follow your prayer direction, nor would you follow their prayer direction; nor would any of them follow the prayer direction of the other. However, if you were to follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, then you would surely be among the wrongdoers.",
153,2,146,"Those whom We gave the Scripture recognize him [i.e., the Prophet] as they recognize their own sons, yet a group of them conceals the truth knowingly[63].",[63] That the Ka‘bah is the correct direction of Prayer.
154,2,147,It is the truth from your Lord; so never be among those who doubt.,
155,2,148,"Every nation has a direction to which it turns, so compete with one another in good deeds. Wherever you are, Allah will bring you all together, for Allah is Most Capable of all things.",
156,2,149,"From wherever you set out, turn your face to the direction of the Sacred Mosque [in Makkah]. This is surely the truth from your Lord, and Allah is not unaware of what you do.",
157,2,150,"From wherever you set out, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque [i.e., Ka‘bah]. Wherever you are, turn your faces towards it, so that the people should not have any proof against you[64], except for the wrongdoers among them. So do not fear them but fear Me, so that I may complete My favor upon you [all] and that you may be guided.",[64] One of the reasons for the change of qiblah was so that the Jews would have no argument against the Muslims.
158,2,151,"Just as We have sent you a messenger from among you, reciting to you Our verses, purifying you, and teaching you the Book and Wisdom[65], and teaching you what you did not know.",[65] The wisdom taught by the Prophet (ﷺ) is his Sunnah.
159,2,152,"Therefore remember Me; I will remember you[66]. Be grateful to Me, and do not be ungrateful.","[66] Remember Me (by praying, glorifying, etc), and I will remember you (by remembering you and bestowing countless favors on you).

[Al-Bukhāri and Muslim]"
160,2,153,"O you who believe, seek help in patience and prayer, for Allah is with those who are patient[67].",[67] Allah is with them; by guiding and supporting them.
161,2,154,"And do not say that those martyred in Allah’s way are dead. Rather, they are alive, but you do not perceive it.",
162,2,155,"We will surely test you with something of fear and famine, and loss of property, lives and fruits. But give glad tidings[68] to those who are patient.","[68] As much as there are hardships and trials, there are rewards and favors."
163,2,156,"Those when afflicted with a disaster, say, “We belong to Allah, and to Him we will return.”",
164,2,157,"They are those upon whom are blessings and mercy from their Lord, and it is they who are guided.",
165,2,158,"Indeed, Safa and Marwah [mounts] are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever performs the pilgrimage or ‘Umra, there is no blame upon him to go between them[69]. And whoever does good voluntarily, then Allah is All-Appreciative, All-Knowing.","[69] Some believers had previously feared that this might be a pagan practice, so Allah confirms that this is among the rites of Islam."
166,2,159,Those who conceal the clear proofs and guidance that We have sent down – after We explained it clearly to people in the Scripture – it is they who are cursed by Allah and will be cursed by those who curse[70].,"[70] From among the angels, the prophets, and the believers."
167,2,160,"Except for those who repent, mend their deeds, and clarify the truth; I will surely accept their repentance, for I am the Accepter of Repentance, the Most Merciful.",

171,2,164,"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and earth; the alternation of the night and day; the sailing of the ships in the sea for the benefit of people; the sending down of rain from the sky by Allah, reviving thereby the earth after its death; the spreading of all kinds of creatures therein; the directing of the winds and clouds between the sky and earth – in all these, there are signs[71] for people of understanding.",[71] There are two āyāt (signs) leading to belief: Quranic verses and cosmic signs. The signs meant in this verse are cosmic.
172,2,165,"And among people, there are some who take others as equals to Allah[72]: they love them as they should love Allah. But those who believe are stronger in their love for Allah. If only the wrongdoers could see the punishment, they would surely realize that all power belongs to Allah and that Allah is severe in punishment.","[72] In spite of all these clear signs, some people still worship false deities besides Allah."
173,2,166,"[Consider] when those who were followed, they will disown their followers when they see the punishment, and all ties between them will be cut off.",
174,2,167,"The followers will say, “If only we could have another chance, so we could disown them as they have disowned us.” Thus will Allah show them their deeds as sources of regret, and they will never get out of the Fire.",

177,2,170,"When it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has sent down,” they say, “Instead, we follow what we found our forefathers doing.” [Would they do so] even though their forefathers had no understanding, nor were they guided?",
178,2,171,"The similitude of those who disbelieved is like cattle not understanding the calls of the shepherd except shouts and cries. They are deaf, dumb, and blind[75]; and they understand nothing.",[75] Their senses are not tuned to divine admonition.
179,2,172,"O you who believe, eat of the good things[76] We have provided for you, and be grateful to Allah, if you truly worship Him alone.",[76] Healthy and wholesome.
180,2,173,"He has only forbidden to you carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, and what has been sacrificed to other than Allah.

181,2,174,"Those who conceal the revelation of Allah’s Book and purchase thereby a small price, consume nothing into their bellies except fire. Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them, and for them there will be a painful punishment.",
182,2,175,They are those who trade guidance for misguidance and forgiveness for punishment. How patient they must be to withstand the Fire[77]!,[77] Allah is mocking their ignorance for exchanging bliss of Paradise with punishment of Hellfire.
183,2,176,That is because Allah has sent down the Book in truth. And those who differ over the Book are surely in extreme dissension.,
184,2,177,"It is not righteousness to turn your faces towards the east or the west, but righteousness is to believe in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Scriptures, and the prophets; and to give charity out of one’s cherished wealth to relatives, orphans, the needy, the wayfarer, beggars, and to free slaves; to establish prayer and give zakah; to fulfill the ratified pledges; to be patient at times of hardship, adversity, and during the battle. Such are the true believers, and such are the righteous.",
185,2,178,"O you who believe, legal retribution is prescribed for you in cases of murder – a free for a free, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. But if one is pardoned by the victim’s guardian, then a fair ransom of blood money should be set and paid in the best way. This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. But whoever transgresses the limits afterward, will have a painful punishment.",
186,2,179,"In the legal retribution, there is [saving of] life for you, O people of understanding, so that you may become righteous.",
187,2,180,"It is prescribed for you that when death approaches one of you – if he leaves behind any wealth – a bequest should be made in favor of parents and immediate family members[78] with fairness, this is a duty upon the righteous.","[78] This ruling was abrogated in Surah an-Nisā’, stipulating obligatory shares for parents and close relatives. Those who do not inherit by law may be remembered in a bequest."

191,2,184,"[Fasting is for] a specific number of days; but if anyone of you is ill or on a journey, he should make up for those days. As for those who can only fast with hardship, compensation can be made by feeding a needy person [for each day]. But anyone who volunteers to give more, it is better for him. Yet fasting is better for you, if only you knew[81].","[81] The provision of this verse has been abrogated by the next verse: 185, with few exceptions, i.e., very old person, or pregnant, etc."
192,2,185,"Ramadān is a month in which the Qur’an was sent down[82] as a guidance for mankind and as clear signs that show the right way and distinguish between right and wrong. So whoever of you witnesses this month, should fast. But if anyone is ill or on a journey, he should make up for those days. Allah wants ease for you and does not want hardship for you, so that you may complete the prescribed number of days, and proclaim the greatness of Allah for having guided you, and so that you may be grateful.","[82] This either means that the Qur’an was sent down from the Preserved Tablet to the Lowest Heaven on the Night of Decree during the month of Ramadan, or that it was the start of the revelation to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)."
193,2,186,"When My slaves ask you concerning Me, I am indeed near[83]. I respond to the call of the supplicant when he calls upon Me; so they should respond to Me and believe in Me, so that they may be guided.",[83] Allah’s nearness means that one does not need to raise his voice or to ask for intercession in order that his prayers be answered.
194,2,187,"It has been made permissible for you to be intimate with your wives on the nights of the fast. They are a garment for you just as you are a garment for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He accepted your repentance and pardoned you. So now you may have intimacy with them[84] and seek what Allah has destined for you. And eat and drink until you see the light of dawn distinct from the darkness of night, then complete the fast until nightfall. However, should you be in a devotional retreat in the mosques then do not be intimate with them. These are the limits set by Allah, so do not even come near to them. This is how Allah makes His verses clear to people, so that they may become righteous.","[84] Prior to this revelation, marital relations were unlawful during nights preceding fasting. Some were unable to refrain and secretly disobeyed, but Allah accepted their repentance, and then it was made lawful."
195,2,188,"Do not consume one another’s property unjustly, nor entice the rulers[85] in order to consume a portion of people’s property wrongfully while you know [it is sin].","[85] By offering bribes to those who rule in cases of litigation, i.e., judges."
196,2,189,"They ask you about the phases of the moon. Say, “They are a means for people to determine time and pilgrimage.” It is not righteousness to enter the houses from the rear [in pilgrimage][86], but righteousness is to fear Allah. So enter the houses through their doors, and fear Allah so that you may succeed.","[86] It was an Arab practice prior to Islam to enter their houses from the back after assuming ihrām for pilgrimage, considering it an act of obedience."

But do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they fight you there. However, if they fight you, then fight them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.","[89] i.e., the disbelievers who raised arms against you. [90] i.e., the land of Makkah from which the Muslims were expelled.

But if you are prevented, then [offer] whatever sacrificial animal is available, and do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal reaches its place of sacrifice. But if anyone among you is sick or has an ailment of the scalp [and had his head shaved], then he must compensate by fasting, charity, or a sacrificial offering[96]. And when you are safe, then if anyone takes a break between ‘Umrah and Hajj, he must offer a sacrifice of whatever animal is available. However, if he cannot afford an offering, he should fast for three days during Hajj and seven days upon his return [home], making ten days in all. This is for those who are not residents of the Sacred Mosque. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is severe in retribution.","[96] Fasting three days, feeding six poor of Haram (sanctified area of Makkah), or slaughtering a sheep or goat and distributing it among the poor of Haram."

207,2,200,"When you have completed your rites, remember Allah as you used to remember your forefathers[99], or even with greater remembrance. There are some people who say, “Our Lord, give us in this world,” but they will have no share in the Hereafter.",[99] The Arabs were very fond of talking without end about the chivalric and heroic deeds of their ancestors.

Then Allah sent prophets with glad tidings and warnings[107], and sent down to them the Scriptures in truth, to judge between people in matters over which they disputed.

For Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path.","[107] Ibn ‘Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) reported: “The time between Adam and Noah was ten centuries. People were on the right path, but then they started disputing over matters of faith. So, Allah sent prophets bearing glad tiding and warning”. ­[Al-Mustadrak of Al-Hākim].

Your wives’ share is one-fourth of your estate if you leave no child, but if you leave a child, they get one-eighth, after settling the bequests or debts. If a man or a woman leaves neither parents nor offspring[10], but has a brother or a sister, each one gets one-sixth[11]; but if they are more than two, they share in one-third, after settling the bequests or debts, without causing harm to the heirs. This is an instruction from Allah; and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.","[10] Kalālah: A person who has no living children or parents; (from iklīl), wreath, as his brothers and sisters surround him like a wreath surrounds the head.

509,4,16,"If two among you commit this [sin], chastise them. Then if they repent and mend their ways, leave them alone[14]. Indeed, Allah is Accepting of Repentance, Most Merciful.","[14] Scholars differed over whether ""the two"" refers to two of the same sex (i.e., homosexuals) or those of opposite sexes.

If they commit adultery after marriage, they are liable to half of the punishment prescribed for free women[18]. This is for those of you who fear falling into sin; but if you stay patient, it is better for you.

Therefore the righteous women are obedient, and protect what Allah has entrusted them with[23] in [their husband’s] absence. As for those women on whose part you fear rebellion[24], [first] admonish them, [next] forsake them in bed, and [last] hit them[25]. Then if they obey you, do not take further action against them.

530,4,37,"those who are stingy and promote stinginess among people[27], and conceal what Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty. We have prepared for disbelievers a humiliating punishment.","[27] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""Everyday two angels come down from heaven; one of them says, ‘O Allah!

531,4,38,"And [also] those who spend their wealth to show off to people, but do not believe in Allah or the Last Day.

If they had said, “We hear and obey,” and “Hear,” and “Wait for us,” it would have been better for them and more proper.

686,5,17,"Those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have certainly disbelieved[19]. Say, “Who has the power to prevent Allah, if He chose to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, his mother, and all those who are on earth?” To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth and everything between them. He creates what He wills, and Allah is Most Capable of all things.",[19] See footnote 4:171.

688,5,19,"O People of the Book, there has come to you Our Messenger[20], making things clear to you, after an interval between the messengers, so you do not say, “No bearer of glad tidings or a warner has ever come to us.” Now there has come to you a bearer of glad tidings and a warner. And Allah is Most Capable of all things.",[20] The only Prophet sent after Jesus (عليه السلام) was Muhammad (ﷺ).
689,5,20,"And [remember] when Moses said to his people, “O my people, remember the favor of Allah upon you when He appointed prophets from among you, made you sovereigns[21], and gave you[22] what He had not given any other people in the world.","[21] Mulūk (lit. kings) could mean: 1. masters served on by others; 2. some were made sovereigns who ruled over people; 3. granted their freedom after being slaves.

Therefore, do not grieve[24] over the rebellious people.”",[24] Allah repeatedly reminds Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) of not falling prey to sadness on account of the disbelievers’ ardent denial.
696,5,27,"Relate to them the story of the two sons of Adam in truth, when both offered a sacrifice; it was accepted from one [i.e., Abel] but not accepted from the other [i.e., Cain][25]. The latter said, “I will kill you.” The former said, “Allah only accepts from those who fear Him.","[25] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “No soul ever gets killed unjustifiably, unless the early son of Adam (Cain) gets some of the burden of its blood, for he was the first human to spill blood”.

Have I failed even to be like this crow to bury the corpse of my brother?” And he became one of the remorseful.",[27] It is said that this raven was burying another of its kind.
701,5,32,"For this reason, We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a person – unless in retribution for murder or corruption in the land – it is as if he killed all mankind[28]; and whoever saves a life, it is as if he saved the life of all mankind. Our messengers came to them with clear signs, yet many of them continued to exceed the limits[29] afterward in the land.","[28] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""The biggest of sins are: (1) To associate partners with Allah, (2) to murder a human being, (3) to be undutiful to one’s parents (4) and to give a false testimony"" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 10]

710,5,41,"O Messenger, do not grieve for those who rush to disbelief – those who say with their mouths, “We believe”, but their hearts have no faith, nor those Jews who eagerly listen to falsehood and to those who have not yet come to you[36]. They distort the words [of Allah] out of their context saying, “If you are given this [ruling] accept it[37], but if you are not given, then beware[38].” Whoever Allah wills to be misguided[39], there is nothing you can do to avail him against Allah. They are those whose hearts Allah did not will to purify. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter they will suffer a great punishment.","[36] They had not attended the Prophet's gatherings or heard his words.

711,5,42,"They eagerly listen to lies and consume unlawful gains. If they come to you [O Prophet], either judge between them or turn away from them.

712,5,43,"But how is it that they seek your judgment when they have the Torah which contains Allah’s judgment, and they still turn away? Such people are not believers.",
713,5,44,"We sent down the Torah which contains guidance and light; the prophets who submitted themselves to Allah were judging by it for the Jews, and so did the rabbis[40] and scholars because they were entrusted to protect the Scripture of Allah, and they were witnesses to it.

714,5,45,"We ordained for them therein, “A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds equal retaliation[42].” But if anyone waives it charitably, then it will be an expiation for him[43]. Whoever does not judge according to what Allah has revealed, it is they who are the wrongdoers.","[42] This verse alludes to the law known as ""lex talionis"" (law of retaliation/reciprocal justice) which states that justice should be carried out: ‘ayin tachat ‘ayin, “an eye for an eye”, as told in the Torah (Exodus 21: 24) but which was distorted from its proper, fully-known position. The Qur’an re-establishes this principle.
 [43] Forgiveness is not only encouraged by Allah but is also rewarded for."
715,5,46,"And in their footsteps[44] We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah that came before him, and We gave him the Gospel that contained guidance and light, confirming what came before it in the Torah; and guidance and admonition for the righteous.","[44] i.e., following the tradition of the prophets of the Children of Israel."

So judge between them according to what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires in disregard of the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have ordained a law and a way of life[46]. If Allah had willed, He would have made you a single community, but He tests you in what He has given you. So compete with one another in doing good deeds. To Allah you will all return, then He will inform you concerning things over which you used to differ.","[45] Muhaymin: that which testifies the truth therein and falsifies the falsehood added to them.
 [46] A fact borne out by millennia that non-Muslim societies (known as dhimmiyyūn) lived and prospered in peace amidst Muslim communities and states. However, the law (shir‘ah) and way of life (minhāj) are different, yet the divinely ordained religion is, in essence, the same. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Prophets are half brothers; their mothers are different but their religion is the same.” [Al-Bukhārī: 3443, Muslim: 2365]"

You healed the born-blind and lepers by My permission, and you brought the dead to life by My permission.

910,6,121,"Do not eat of that [meat] over which the name of Allah is not mentioned, for this is a grave disobedience. But the devils whisper to their [human] friends to argue with you; if you were to obey them[39], you would surely become polytheists.",[39] As obedience being the basis of worship.
911,6,122,Is the one who was dead and We gave him life [by faith] and gave him a light with which he walks among people like the one in darkness from which he can never escape[40]? This is how the deeds of the disbelievers have been made appealing to them.,[40] The simile given here is about someone who is guided by light of guidance and someone who is bereft of the light of guidance.
912,6,123,"Thus We have placed in every city the most wicked ones to conspire in it, yet they only conspire against themselves, without even realizing it.",
913,6,124,"When a sign comes to them, they say, “We will never believe until we are given the like of what was given to the messengers of Allah.” Allah knows best where to place His message. Those who are wicked will be afflicted with disgrace from Allah and a severe punishment for their plots.",
914,6,125,"Whoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his heart to Islam; and whoever He wills to lead astray, He makes his heart tight and constricted[41], as if he were climbing up into the sky. This is how Allah punishes those who do not believe.",[41] Due to his arrogance and persistence in sin.
915,6,126,This is the straight path of your Lord. We have made the verses clear for people who take heed.,

918,6,129,This is how We make the wrongdoers take control over one another[43] because of what they used to do.,[43] By misguiding and inciting to do evil deeds.
919,6,130,"“O assembly of jinn and humans, did there not come to you messengers from among you, reciting to you My verses and warning you of meeting this Day of yours?” They will say, “We testify against ourselves.” They were deluded by the life of this world, and they will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.",

925,6,136,"They assign to Allah a portion of the crops and livestock He created, saying, “This is for Allah” – as they claim – “and this is for our partners [i.e., idols].” But that which is assigned for their partners does not reach Allah, while that which is assigned for Allah reaches their partners[44]. How unfair their judgment is!","[44] It was an Arab heathen ritual to allocate two shares out of their livestock; a share for God and a share for idols. If a portion of God’s share was mixed with that of their idols, they would not deduct it, saying that God is in no need of it. Yet if a portion of their idols’ share fell with that of God’s they would readily cut it and add it on to their idols’ share."
926,6,137,"Similarly, the evil associates of the pagans have made the killing of their children[45] appealing to them, in order to lead them to destruction and confuse them in their faith.

1029,7,75,"The arrogant chiefs of his people said to those believers who were oppressed, “Do you really know that Sālih has been sent by his Lord?” They said, “We surely believe in what he has been sent with.”",
1030,7,76,"Those who were arrogant said, “As for us, we surely disbelieve in what you believe.”",
1031,7,77,"Then they killed the she-camel and defied their Lord’s command, and said, “Bring us what you are threatening us if you are indeed one of the messengers.”",
1032,7,78,"Then an earthquake seized them, and they fell lifeless in their homes.",
1033,7,79,"So he turned away from them, saying, “O my people, I did convey my Lord’s message to you and gave you sincere advice, but you do not like sincere advisers.”",
1034,7,80,"And [We sent] Lot, when he said to his people, “Do you commit such a shameful act[29] that nobody has ever done before you?","[29] The only messenger mentioned here did not begin his call to worship Allah alone, due to the sheer vileness they were involved in, namely, sodomy."
1035,7,81,For you approach men lustfully instead of women; you are but a transgressing people[30].”,[30] Because they transgressed the limits of moderation.
1036,7,82,"The only reply his people gave was to say, “Drive them out of your town, for they are people who keep themselves pure[31]!”",[31] Their only charge was that they were ‘pure’.
1037,7,83,So We saved him and his family except his wife[32]; she was one of those who remained behind.,"[32] Because she condoned the degrading behavior of her people, and she was a disbeliever."
1038,7,84,And We rained down upon them a rain [of brimstone]. So see how was the end of the evildoers.,
1039,7,85,"And to the people of Midian [We sent] their brother Shu‘ayb. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god other than Him. There has come to you a clear proof from your Lord. Give full measure and weight, and do not defraud people of their property[33], and do not spread corruption in the land after it has been set aright. That is best for you, if you are [truly] believers.",[33] Their sin was wantonly engaging in swindling defraud in dealings.
1040,7,86,"Do not lie in wait on every path, threatening and preventing from Allah’s path[34] those who believe in Him, and seeking to make it crooked. Remember when you were few, then He increased you in number. See how was the end of those who spread corruption.",[34] They were also engaged in highway robberies and preventing people from listening to Shu‘ayb.
1041,7,87,"If there are some among you who believe in what I have been sent with, while others do not believe, then be patient until Allah judges between us, and He is the Best of Judges.”",
1042,7,88,"The arrogant chiefs of his people said, “O Shu‘ayb, we will surely drive you and those who believe with you out of our town unless you return to our faith.” He said, “Even if we detest it?",
1043,7,89,"We would be fabricating lies against Allah if we were to return to your faith after Allah has saved us from it. We will not return to it unless Our Lord Allah so wills. Our Lord has full knowledge of everything. In Allah we put our trust. Our Lord, judge between us and our people with truth, for You are the Best of the Judges.”",
1044,7,90,"The disbelieving chiefs of his people said, “If you follow Shu‘ayb, you will certainly be losers[35].”",[35] In financial terms.
1045,7,91,Then they were seized by the earthquake and they fell lifeless in their homes.,
1046,7,92,Those who rejected Shu‘ayb became as if they had never lived there. Those who rejected Shu‘ayb were themselves the losers[36].,"[36] Not the believers as they claimed, as they lost both worlds."
1047,7,93,"So he turned away from them and said, “O my people, I did convey to you the messages of my Lord, and gave you sincere advice. Why should I grieve for a disbelieving people?”",
1048,7,94,"We have not sent any prophet to a town, but We seized its people with poverty and adversity, so that they may humble themselves.",
1049,7,95,"Then We changed their adversity into prosperity until they flourished and said, “Our forefathers were also afflicted with hardship and ease.” Then We seized them by surprise while they were unaware.",
1050,7,96,"If only the people of the towns had believed and feared Allah, We would have certainly opened for them blessings from the heaven and earth. But they disbelieved, so We seized them for what they earned.",
1051,7,97,Do the people of the towns feel secure that Our punishment will not befall them by night while they are asleep?,
1052,7,98,Or do the people of the towns feel secure that Our punishment will not befall them by day while they are at play?,
1053,7,99,Do they feel secure from the plan of Allah? None can feel secure from the plan of Allah[37] except the loser people.,"[37] Even the most devout believers, as hearts are between the two Fingers of Allah, He directs it wherever He wishes."
1054,7,100,"Is it not clear to those who inherit the land after its former people that, if We so willed, We could punish them for their sins and seal up their hearts so that they do not hear[38]?",[38] For they do not benefit from what they hear.
1055,7,101,"These are the towns, some of whose stories We relate to you. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they were not about to believe in what they had already rejected[39]. This is how Allah seals up the hearts of the disbelievers.","[39] i.e., they persistently denied warnings given to them."
1056,7,102,We did not find most of them committed to their covenant; rather We found most of them rebellious.,
1057,7,103,"Then We sent after them Moses[40] with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. See how was the end of those who spread corruption.","[40] Moses’ story is recounted in detail in many surahs, for his mission bears the most similarities with that of the Prophet (ﷺ)."
1058,7,104,"Moses said, “O Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds.",
1059,7,105,"I am obliged to say nothing concerning Allah except the truth. I have come to you with clear proof from your Lord, so let the Children of Israel go[41] with me.”","[41] i.e., let them emigrate."
1060,7,106,"Pharaoh said, “If you have brought a sign, then bring it forth if you are truthful.”",
1061,7,107,"So he threw his staff, and it suddenly became a real serpent[42].","[42] As a miracle from Allah. In ancient Egypt, the cobra snake, known as the uraeus, was used as a symbol of sovereignty and divine authority worn on the headdresses and crowns."
1062,7,108,"And he drew out his hand, and it was shining white[43] to the beholders.","[43] As a miracle from Allah. The hands of the Children of Israel used to be rough and scratchy out of labor and toil for their masters, for they were bondsmen and slaves."
1063,7,109,"The chiefs among Pharaoh’s people said, “This is indeed a learned magician!",
1064,7,110,"He seeks to drive you out of your land. [Pharaoh said], “So what do you advise?”",
1065,7,111,"They said, “Let him and his brother wait for a while and send heralds to the cities",
1066,7,112,to bring you every learned magician.”,
1067,7,113,"The magicians came to Pharaoh and said, “Will we have a reward if we prevail?”",
1068,7,114,"He said, “Yes, and you will surely be of those who are close to me.”",
1069,7,115,"They said, “O Moses, will you throw first or will we be the first to throw?”",
1070,7,116,"He said, “You throw first.” So when they threw, they enchanted the eyes of the people and struck terror into them, and produced a powerful magic.",
1071,7,117,"We inspired Moses, “Throw your staff,” and it suddenly swallowed up all their illusionary devices.",
1072,7,118,"Thus the truth prevailed, and all what they did was proven to be false.",
1073,7,119,They were defeated right there and were utterly humiliated.,
1074,7,120,"The magicians fell down in prostration,",
1075,7,121,"and said, “We believe in the Lord of the worlds,",
1076,7,122,the Lord of Moses and Aaron.”,
1077,7,123,"Pharaoh said, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission! This is indeed a plot that you devised in the city to drive out its people, but you will soon come to know.",
1078,7,124,"I will surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then I will crucify you all together.”",
1079,7,125,"They said, “We are surely returning to our Lord.",
1080,7,126,"Your only vengeance against us is because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us[44]. Our Lord, shower upon us patience and let us die as Muslims, submitting to You.”",[44] It implies deriding Pharaoh for his skewed standards.
1081,7,127,"The chiefs among Pharaoh’s people said, “Will you leave Moses and his people to spread corruption in the land, and abandon you and your gods?” He said, “We will kill their sons and spare their women, for we have full dominance over them.”",
1082,7,128,"Moses said to his people, “Seek help from Allah and be patient. The earth belongs to Allah; He gives it as an inheritance to whom He wills of His slaves, but the outcome is for those who fear Allah.”",
1083,7,129,"They said, “We were oppressed before you came to us and after you came.” He said, “It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land to see how you will do.”",
1084,7,130,"We afflicted the people of Pharaoh with famine and poor harvests, so that they may take heed.",
1085,7,131,"When prosperity came their way, they said, “This is what we deserve[45],” but when adversity befell them, they ascribed it to the misfortune of Moses and those who were with him. Indeed, their misfortune is decreed by Allah, but most of them do not know.","[45] Out of egotism and smugness, they felt they deserved all good things."
1086,7,132,"They said, “No matter what sign you may bring to enchant us, we are not going to believe in you.”",
1087,7,133,"So We sent upon them flood, locusts, lice, frogs and blood – as clear signs, yet they persisted in arrogance and were a wicked people.",
1088,7,134,"When a scourge befell them, they said, “O Moses, call upon your Lord for us by virtue of the covenant He has made to you; if you remove the scourge from us, we will surely believe in you and will let the Children of Israel go with you.”",
1089,7,135,"But when We removed the scourge from them until an appointed term that they were bound to reach, they broke their promise.",
1090,7,136,So We subjected them to retribution and drowned them in the sea because they rejected Our signs and were heedless of them.,
1091,7,137,"And We made the people who had been oppressed to inherit the lands of the east and west that We had blessed. The good word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of what they endured patiently, and We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people used to make and what they used to construct.",
1092,7,138,"We led the Children of Israel across the sea, then they came upon a people who were devoted to their idols. They said, “O Moses, make for us a god just as they have gods.” He said, “You are indeed an ignorant people.",
1093,7,139,"Indeed, what they follow is doomed to destruction and what they do is worthless.”",
1094,7,140,"He said, “Shall I seek for you a god[46] other than Allah when He has favored you above the worlds?”","[46] i.e., an object of worship."
1095,7,141,"And [remember] when We saved you from the people of Pharaoh, who were afflicting you with the worst punishment – killing your sons and sparing your women. That was a great trial from your Lord.",
1096,7,142,"We appointed for Moses thirty nights and completed it with ten more, whereby the term of forty nights set by Allah was fulfilled. Moses said to his brother Aaron, “Take my place among my people in my absence, keep things right, and do not follow the way of those who spread corruption.”",
1097,7,143,"When Moses came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, “My Lord, reveal Yourself to me so that I may look at You.” Allah said, “You will not be able to see Me[47]. But look at the mountain; if it stays firm in its place, only then will you see Me.” When his Lord appeared to the mountain, it was leveled to dust and Moses fell unconscious. When he recovered, he said, “Glory be to You! I repent to You and I am the first of the believers.”",[47] None can see Allah in the life of this world.
1098,7,144,"He said, “O Moses, I have chosen you above other people, by giving you My messages and speaking to you. So hold fast to what I have given you, and be of those who are grateful.”",
1099,7,145,We inscribed for him in the Tablets admonition of all things and explanation of everything. “Hold fast to them and ask your people to follow the best of it. I will show you the home of the rebellious[48].,[48] A severe warning against rebellion.
1100,7,146,"I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant[49] in the land without any right. Even if they see every sign, they will still not believe in it; if they see the way of guidance, they will not follow it, but if they see the way of misguidance, they will follow it as their way. That is because they have rejected Our signs and were heedless of them.","[49] Arrogance is pointed out as a major cause for disbelief, as the arrogant will not hearken to admonition or to advice."
1101,7,147,"Those who reject Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter, their deeds will become worthless. Will they not be recompensed except for what they used to do?",
1102,7,148,"In his absence, the people of Moses took for worship an image of calf made from their jewelry that made a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor could it guide them[50] to any [straight] way? Yet they took it for worship and they were wrongdoers.","[50] This mere body even lacked the basic attributes of being a god, as it was unable to speak to them or benefit them."
1103,7,149,"When they became remorseful and realized that they had gone astray, they said, “If our Lord does not have mercy upon us and forgive us, we will certainly be among the losers.”",
1104,7,150,"When Moses returned to his people, furious and grieved, he said, “What an evil thing you did in my absence! Did you seek to hasten the command of your Lord[51]?” He threw the Tablets[52] and grabbed his brother by the hair, dragging him towards himself. Aaron said, “O son of my mother, the people overpowered me and were about to kill me. Do not make my enemies rejoice over me, nor count me among the people of wrongdoing.”","[51] i.e., “Could you not have waited until I came back to you with your Lord’s good guidance?”.
 [52] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Hearing is not like seeing. Allah told Moses of what his people did with the calf and he did not throw down the tablets. Yet, when he actually saw what they did he threw them down!” [Imām Aḥmad: 2447; Ibn Hibbān: 6213]"
1105,7,151,"Moses said, “My Lord, forgive me and my brother[53], and admit us into Your mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.”",[53] He practically apologized to his brother and accepted his explanation.
1106,7,152,"As for those who took the calf for worship, they will certainly be afflicted with wrath from their Lord and disgrace in the life of this world. This is how We recompense those who invent falsehood.",
1107,7,153,"But those who commit evil deeds, then repent thereafter and [truly] believe, then your Lord is indeed All-Forgiving[54], Most Merciful.","[54] This shows that no matter how grave the sin is, Allah will forgive it if the person truly repents and believes."
1108,7,154,"When Moses’ fury calmed down, he picked up the Tablets; in their inscription there was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord.",
1109,7,155,"Moses chose seventy men from among his people for Our appointment. When the earthquake seized them[55], he said, “My Lord, had it been Your will, You could have destroyed them earlier, and me too; will You destroy us for what the fools among us have done? This is not but a trial from You, by which You cause to stray whom You will and guide whom You will. You are our Guardian, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, for You are the Best of Forgivers.","[55] When they reached the appointed place, they said to Moses, ""O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah openly."" (2:55) So the mountain convulsed, killing them."
1110,7,156,"Ordain for us good in this life and in the Hereafter, for We have turned to You in repentance.” Allah said, “As for my punishment, I will afflict with it whom I will[56], but My mercy encompasses everything; I will ordain it for those who fear Me, and give zakah, and those who believe in Our verses[57],","[56] Among those who deserve punishment.
 [57] Three conditions are necessary for earning Allah’s Mercy: 1. Being Mindful of Him. 2. Giving out zakah. 3. Believing in Allah’s verses and signs."
1111,7,157,"those who follow the Messenger – the unlettered Prophet – whose description they find in their Torah and the Gospel. He enjoins them to do what is good and forbids them from what is evil; he makes lawful for them what is pure and makes unlawful for them what is impure; he relieves them of their burden[58] and the shackles[59] that were on them. So those who believe in him, they honor and support him, and follow the light which is sent down with him – it is they who will be successful.”","[58] i.e., difficulties in religious duties.
 [59] i.e., extreme measures previously required for repentance and retribution without recourse to compensation."
1112,7,158,"Say [O Prophet], “O people, I am the Messenger of Allah to you all[60]. To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth; none has the right to be worshiped except Him; He gives life and causes death.” So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in Allah and His words, and follow him, so that you may be guided.","[60] This call is to all people since the time of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), including the People of the Book and others."
1113,7,159,Among the people of Moses there is a community which guides others with truth[61] and establishes justice therewith.,"[61] Those who followed the final prophet, Muhammad (ﷺ)."
1114,7,160,"We divided them into twelve tribes[62], each as a community, and We inspired Moses when his people asked him for water, “Strike the rock with your staff.” There gushed forth from it twelve springs; each tribe knew the place of its drinking. We shaded them with clouds and sent down to them manna and quails, “Eat of the good things We have provided for you.” They did not wrong Us, but it was themselves that they wronged.",[62] From the twelve sons of Jacob.
1115,7,161,"When it was said to them, “Live in this city [of Jerusalem], and eat from wherever you please, and say, ‘Absolve us,’ and enter the gate bowing with humility; We will forgive you your sins, and increase the reward of those who do good.”",
1116,7,162,But the wrongdoers among them altered the words to something other than what they were told; so We sent down upon them a scourge from the heaven for their wrongdoing.,
1117,7,163,"Ask them [O Prophet] about the town which was by the sea and how they broke the Sabbath[63]. The fish would come to them appearing on the surface of the water on Sabbath days, but when it was not Sabbath, they would not come. This is how We tested them for their rebelliousness.",[63] This is another act of violation some of them committed.
1118,7,164,"When a group of them said, “Why are you admonishing a people whom Allah will destroy or punish severely?” They said, “To excuse ourselves before your Lord, and perhaps they may fear Allah.”",
1119,7,165,"When they ignored the admonition they were given, We saved those who forbade evil and seized the wrongdoers with a grievous punishment for their defiant disobedience.",
1120,7,166,"When they persistently violated what they were forbidden to do, We said to them, “Be despised apes[64].”","[64] Their deed was deceptive, only outwardly resembling observance of Allah’s commands. As such, Allah turned them into apes, only outwardly resembling humans, but were actually far apart from real humans."
1121,7,167,"And [remember] when your Lord declared that He would send against them those who would afflict them with a terrible punishment[67] until the Day of Resurrection. Your Lord is Swift in Punishment, but He also is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",[67] This is for their constantly disparaging their pledge with Allah.
1122,7,168,"We scattered them[68] through the land in communities – some of them were righteous and others were less so. We tested them with both prosperity and adversity, so that they would return [to Allah’s Obedience].",[68] This is an allusion to the Jewish Diaspora and their dispersion out of their lands. See 17:4-8.
1123,7,169,"They were then succeeded by other generations who inherited the Scripture, opting for the lowly gains[69], and saying, “We will be forgiven[70].” Yet if a similar gain[71] comes their way, they will seize it. Was not a covenant of the Scripture taken from them that they should not say about Allah except the truth, and they had studied its teachings? But the Home of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah. Do you not understand?","[69] i.e., unlawful gains and pleasures.
 [70] It demonstrates how self-justifying they were in sticking to their devious ways.
 [71] i.e., a similar temptation."
1124,7,170,"As for those who hold fast to the Scripture and establish prayer, We will not let the reward of those who seek righteousness to be lost.",
1125,7,171,"And [remember] when We raised the mountain over them as if it were a dark cloud, and they thought that it would fall upon them, “Hold fast to what We have given you[72] and observe its teachings, so that you may fear Allah.”",[72] For their persistent rebellion and disobedience.
1126,7,172,"And [remember] when your Lord brought forth from the loins of the children of Adam their offspring and made them testify about themselves [asking], “Am I not your Lord?” They said, “Yes indeed; We testify[73].” [We did so] lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, “We were unaware of this,”",[73] This is alluding to the ‘mīthāq al-fitrah’ (the pledge of innate nature).
1127,7,173,"Or that you say, “It was our forefathers before us who associated partners with Allah, and we are their offspring who came after them. Will you then destroy us for the falsehood that they invented?”",
1128,7,174,"This is how We make the verses clear, so that they may return.",
1129,7,175,"And relate to them [O Prophet] the story of the one[74] whom We gave knowledge of Our revelations, but he abandoned it, so Satan took hold of him and he became one of the deviants.",[74] A man from the Children of Israel at the time of Moses.
1130,7,176,"If We had willed, We could have elevated him thereby[75], but he clung to the [life of the] earth[76] and followed his desires. His likeness is that of a dog: if you attack it, it pants with its tongue lolling, and if you leave it, it still pants[77]. Such is the example of the people who reject Our revelations. Therefore, relate the stories, so that they may reflect.","[75] i.e., by the knowledge of the revelations. [76] i.e., its worldly pleasures.
 [77] No matter whether they are admonished or not, they will not believe."
1131,7,177,"How evil is the likeness of people who rejected Our verses, and it is themselves that they have wronged.",
1132,7,178,"Whoever Allah guides is rightly guided; and whoever He causes to stray[78], it is they who are the losers.",[78] Due to persistence in evil and rejecting the truth.
1133,7,179,"We have surely created for Hell many jinn and humans. They have hearts with which they do not understand, eyes with which they do not see, and ears with which they do not hear[79]. They are like cattle[80], rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless.","[79] As they willfully fail to use their faculties of discernment and understanding.
 [80] They only care to satiate their animalistic drives, not about the life to come, so they are no better than livestock."
1134,7,180,"Allah has the Most Beautiful Names, so call upon Him by them, and leave those who deviate concerning His Names[81]. They will be recompensed for what they used to do.","[81] i.e., use them improperly such as calling other gods besides Allah by them, or deny them, or distort their meanings."
1135,7,181,And among those whom We created is a group[82] that guides others with the truth and establishes justice therewith.,[82] The followers of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ).
1136,7,182,"As for those who reject Our signs, We will gradually lead them to destruction[83] without them realizing it.",[83] By giving them one favor after another which only increases them in arrogance and sin.
1137,7,183,"I will give them respite, but My plan is firm.",
1138,7,184,Have they not reflected that their fellow [Prophet] is not insane? He is none but a clear warner.,
1139,7,185,"Have they not observed the dominions of the heavens and earth and all that Allah has created, and that the end of their term might be near? In what message after this [Qur’an] will they then believe?",
1140,7,186,"Whoever Allah causes to stray, there is none to guide him; He will leave them to wander blindly in their transgression.",
1141,7,187,"They ask you [O Prophet] about the Hour, “When will it come to pass?” Say, “Its knowledge is only with my Lord. None can reveal its due time except Him. It will be heavy on the heavens and earth; it will only come to you by surprise.” They ask you as if you are well-aware of it. Say, “Its knowledge is only with Allah, but most people do not know.”",
1142,7,188,"Say, “I have no power to benefit or harm myself, except what Allah wills. If I had knowledge of the unseen, I would have acquired much good, and no evil would have touched me. I am only a warner and bearer of glad tidings for people who believe.”",
1143,7,189,"It is He Who created you from a single soul, and from it He made its spouse[84], so that he may find comfort in her. When he covered her[85], she conceived a light burden carrying it with ease.

1144,7,190,"But when He gave them a healthy child, they[87] ascribed partners to Him in that which He had given them. Exalted is Allah far above what they ascribe to Him.",[87] The ungrateful or the polytheistic man and woman.

 [30] ‘Adiyy ibn Hātim al-Tā’iyy (رضي الله عنه), who was Christian before embracing Islam, narrated that he came to the Messenger (ﷺ) while he was reciting this verse, and he said to the Messenger: “We do not worship them!” He asked: “Do they not deem unlawful what Allah allowed and you follow them making it unlawful, and declare lawful what Allah forbade and you follow them making it lawful?” ‘Adiyy said: “Indeed!” then he (ﷺ) said: “That is their worship!” [At-Tirmidhī: 3095; also see: Matthew 15:1-9, Isaiah 29:13, Jeremiah 8:8]"
1267,9,32,"They seek to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah refuses except to perfect His light, even if the disbelievers hate it.",
1268,9,33,"It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, so that He may make it prevail over all other religions, even though the polytheists dislike it.",
1269,9,34,"O you who believe, there are many rabbis and monks who consume people’s wealth unlawfully and prevent people from Allah’s way. Those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in the way of Allah, give them tidings of a painful punishment.",
1270,9,35,"On the Day when their treasures[31] will be heated up in the Fire of Hell, and their foreheads, sides and backs will be branded therewith. [They will be told], “This is what you hoarded for yourselves; so taste [the punishment of] what you used to hoard.”",[31] The hoarded gold and silver whose zakah was not paid.
1271,9,36,"The number of months with Allah is twelve, in the Record of Allah[32] since the day He created the heavens and earth; of which four are sacred. This is the straight way, so do not wrong yourselves during these months[33], and fight the polytheists all together[34], just as they fight you all together. And know that Allah is with those who fear Him.","[32] i.e., the Preserved Tablet.
 [33] i.e., do not violate the sacred months or commit aggression therein; they are: 1st, 7th, 11th, 12th months of the lunar calendar.
 [34] See 2:193, 8:73."
1272,9,37,"The postponement of [Sacred Months] is an act of disbelief[35], which leads them further astray. They declare a month lawful in one year and sacred the next year, in order to match the number of months that Allah has declared as sacred, thus making lawful what Allah has made forbidden[36]; their evil deeds have been made appealing to them, and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.","[35] Fighting during a sacred month.
 [36] If they found it advantageous to violate a sacred month, they would do so, designating another month sacrosanct instead to observe the restrictions of fighting."
1273,9,38,"O you who believe, what is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of Allah, you cling heavily to the earth[37]? Are you content with the life of this world instead of the Hereafter? But the enjoyment of the life of this world is insignificant compared to that of the Hereafter.","[37] i.e., inclining toward the comforts of the worldly life."
1274,9,39,"Unless you march forth, He will chastise you with a painful punishment and replace you with other people, and you cannot harm Him in the least, for Allah is Most Capable of all things.",
1275,9,40,"If you do not support the Prophet, Allah has already supported him when the disbelievers forced him out; when he was second of the two[38] in the cave – saying to his companion, “Do not grieve; Allah is with us.” Thereupon Allah sent down His tranquility upon him, supported him with soldiers that you did not see[39], and rendered the word of the disbelievers[40] the lowest, whereas the Word of Allah[41] is supreme. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.","[38] The second was his companion, Abu Bakr.
 [39] Angels came to the Prophet’s aid in the small cave.

1276,9,41,"March forth, whether lightly or heavily armed[42], and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is best for you, if only you knew.","[42] i.e., young or old, riding or walking, in ease or in hardship - in all circumstances; those who are exempted is mentioned in the verse 91 below."
1277,9,42,"If it had been an easy win within reach and a short journey, those [hypocrites] would have followed you, but the distance seemed too far for them. They will swear by Allah[43], “If we had been able, we would have surely joined you,” destroying themselves [through false oaths], and Allah knows that they are liars.",[43] When you return from the Tabūk expedition in which the hypocrites did not participate.
1278,9,43,"May Allah pardon you [O Prophet]! Why did you give them permission [to stay behind] before it became clear to you as to who were telling the truth, and who were liars[44]?","[44] None should have been given permission, so as to see who would set out with the Muslim army, the truthful; and who would not, the liars."
1279,9,44,Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will not ask you to be exempted from striving with their wealth and their lives in Allah’s cause. Allah is All-Knowing of those who fear Him.,
1280,9,45,"Only those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day ask permission to be exempted; they have doubts in their hearts, so they will continue to waver in their doubts.",
1281,9,46,"If they had truly intended to march forth, they would have made necessary preparations for it. But Allah disliked their going forth, so He made them lag behind, and they were told, “Stay behind with those who are staying behind[45].”","[45] i.e., the terminally weak, women and children."
1282,9,47,"If they had gone forth with you, they would have only increased you in disorder and would have scurried around, sowing discord among you, and some of you would have listened to them. And Allah is All-Knowing of the wrongdoers.",
1283,9,48,"They had surely sought to sow discord before and devised plots against you [O Prophet][46] until the truth [i.e., victory] came and Allah’s decree [i.e., religion] prevailed, even though they were averse.",[46] They spared no effort to put their insidious artifice into action against the Prophet (ﷺ) and the believers.
1284,9,49,"There are some among them who say, “Exempt me and do not expose me to temptation.” They have already fallen into temptation[47]. Hell will certainly encompass the disbelievers.","[47] By avoiding their obligations, they fell into destruction."
1285,9,50,"If something good happens to you, it grieves them, but if a disaster befalls you, they say, “We have taken our precautions beforehand[48],” and they turn away rejoicing.",[48] The hypocrites claim to have protected themselves by not setting out on the campaign.
1286,9,51,"Say, “Nothing will ever befall us except that which Allah has decreed for us; He is our Protector.” And in Allah alone let the believers put their trust.",
1287,9,52,"Say, “Are you awaiting to befall us except one of the two fine things [i.e., victory or martyrdom][49]? But we are awaiting that Allah will afflict you with punishment from Himself or at our hands. So wait; we too are waiting with you.”","[49] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “When your brothers were struck down in the Battle of Badr, Allah placed their souls in the abdominal cavities of green fowls, they drink from the rivers of Paradise, eat from its fruits and come back at the end of the day to repose in chandeliers hung in the Shadow of the Majestic Throne...” [Abū Dāwūd: 2520, Ahmad: 2388]"
1288,9,53,"Say, “Whether you spend willingly or unwillingly, it will never be accepted from you, for you have been a wicked people.”",
1289,9,54,"Nothing prevents the acceptance of their spending except that they disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger, they do not come to prayer but lazily[50], and they do not spend but reluctantly.","[50] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""No prayer is heavier for the hypocrites than the Fajr and the ‘Isha’ prayers; but if they knew the reward for these prayers at their respective times, they would certainly attend even if they had to crawl..."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 626]"
1290,9,55,So do not let their wealth or their children impress you; Allah only intends to punish them through these things in the life of this world and to let their souls depart while they are still disbelievers.,
1291,9,56,"They swear by Allah that they belong to you[51], but they do not belong to you; rather they are a people who are afraid [of you].","[51] In their precarious situation, they lie as a line of defence."
1292,9,57,"If they could find a refuge, caves, or a place to hide, they would rush headlong to it[52].",[52] A vividly depiction of their life of constant distress and anguish.
1293,9,58,"There are some among them who criticize you [O Prophet] concerning alms[53]; if they are given something thereof, they are pleased, but if they are not given, they are enraged.",[53] The hypocrites would insinuate that the noble Messenger (ﷺ) was not fair in dividing zakah revenues.
1294,9,59,"If only they had been pleased with that which Allah and His Messenger gave them, and said, “Allah is sufficient for us; Allah will give us out of His bounty, and so will His Messenger; to Allah alone we turn with hope.”",
1295,9,60,"Alms [i.e., zakah] is only for the poor and the needy; those in charge of it; those whose hearts may be attracted [to Islam]; for freeing those in bondage; for those in debt; for the cause of Allah; and for [the stranded] traveler[54] – as ordained by Allah, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.","[54] See 2:83, 2:273."
1296,9,61,"Among those [hypocrites] are some who offend the Prophet and say, “He listens to everyone[55].” Say [O Prophet], “He listens to what is best for you[56]; he believes in Allah, trusts the believers, and is a mercy for those of you who believe.” But for those who offend the Messenger of Allah, there will be a painful punishment.","[55] i.e., he believes everything he hears.
 [56] i.e., he listens but to what is good and not to evil; he listens and overlooks; he turns a blind eye when you come with fabrications."
1297,9,62,"They swear by Allah to you [O Muslims] to please you, but it is Allah and His Messenger whose pleasure they should seek, if they are true believers.",
1298,9,63,Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger will dwell in the Fire of Hell forever? That is the ultimate disgrace.,
1299,9,64,"The hypocrites fear that a chapter should be sent down about them, informing [the believers] of what is in their hearts[57]. Say [O Prophet], “Keep on mocking! Allah will certainly expose what you fear.”","[57] i.e., exposing their disbelief."
1300,9,65,"If you question them, they will surely say, “We were only indulging in idle talk and playing.” Say, “Was it Allah, His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking[58]?”","[58] ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar (رضي الله عنهما) reported: “During the Tabuk Expedition a man said in a gathering: “I have not seen anyone who is more gluttonous, lying and cowardly than these reciters of ours!” A man in the same gathering replied to him: “Liar! You are indeed a hypocrite! I shall tell the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)!” When the news reached the Messenger (ﷺ), verses from the Qur’an came down regarding the incident.” The narrator continues: “I saw him clinging to the belly strap of the Messenger’s (ﷺ) she-camel, saying: “Messenger of Allah! We were only chit-chatting and passing time!” While the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was reciting: “Were you mocking of Allah, His Signs, and His Messenger”. [cf. Ibn Abī Hātim, al-Tabarī, al-Shinqītī]"
1301,9,66,"Make no excuses; you have disbelieved after having believed[59]. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others because they are wicked.","[59] However, the door of repentance is still open for them."
1302,9,67,"The hypocrites, both men and women, are all alike; they enjoin what is evil and forbid what is good, and they withhold their hands [from giving][60]. They forgot Allah, so He forgot them. Indeed, the hypocrites are the rebellious.","[60] i.e., from spending in the way of Allah."
1303,9,68,"Allah has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers the Fire of Hell, abiding therein forever – it is sufficient for them. Allah has cursed them, and for them there will be an everlasting punishment.",
1304,9,69,"[O hypocrites, you are] like those who came before you, who were more powerful than you and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share, and you too have enjoyed your share just as those who came before you enjoyed their share; and you have indulged in idle talk just as they did. Such are those whose deeds have become worthless in this world and in the Hereafter; it is they who are the losers.",
1305,9,70,"Have they not received the stories of those who came before them: the people of Noah, ‘Ād, Thamūd, the people of Abraham, the dwellers of Midian, and the overturned cities [of Lot]? Their messengers came to them with clear signs. It was not Allah who wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.",
1306,9,71,"The believers, both men and women, are allies of one another; they enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, they establish prayer, give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. It is they who will receive Allah’s mercy, for Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.",
1307,9,72,"Allah has promised the believers, both men and women, gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever, and splendid dwellings in the Gardens of Eternity, and Allah’s pleasure, which is the greatest of all; that is the supreme triumph.",
1308,9,73,"O Prophet, strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be harsh with them. Their abode is Hell. What a terrible destination!",
1309,9,74,"They swear by Allah that they said nothing [blasphemous], while they indeed uttered a word of blasphemy[61], and disbelieved after accepting Islam, and plotted what they could not achieve[62]. They are spiteful [against believers] for no reason except that Allah and His Messenger have enriched them out of His bounty. If they repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away, Allah will chastise them with a painful punishment in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have on earth no protector or helper.","[61] such as insulting the Messenger (ﷺ) and attacking the religion.
 [62] They devised to assassinate the Prophet (ﷺ) upon his return from the Tabuk Expedition, but their plot was foiled."
1310,9,75,"There are some among them who made a covenant with Allah: “If He gives us out of His bounty, we will surely spend in charity and be among the righteous.”",
1311,9,76,"But when He did give them out of His bounty, they grew stingy and turned away in aversion.",
1312,9,77,"So as a consequence, He caused hypocrisy to take root in their hearts until the Day they meet Him, because of breaking their promise to Allah, and because of their persistent lying.",
1313,9,78,Do they not know that Allah knows their secret and private conversations and that Allah is the All-Knower of all unseen?,
1314,9,79,"Those who disparage the believers who voluntarily give charities and ridicule them for having nothing to give except their effort[63]. Allah will ridicule them, and for them there will be a painful punishment.","[63] They hurtle sneering comments on both the well-off who give generously, saying that they do so out of show off, and those who can only help with the very little they have, and deride them for it."
1315,9,80,"Whether you [O Prophet] seek forgiveness for them or not, even if you seek forgiveness for them seventy times[64], Allah will never forgive them[65]; that is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger. Allah does not guide the rebellious people.","[64] The number 70 is not meant, but is rather used to denote numerousness per se.
 [65] ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb (رضي الله عنه) reported: “When ‘Abdullāh ibn ’Ubayy ibn Salūl died, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was summoned to Pray for him. As He (ﷺ) stood up, I sprang to him and said: “Messenger of Allah, will you pray over Ibn ’Ubayy, in spite of him saying so and so on the day of so and so!” I recounted to him (ﷺ) what he said. The Messenger (ﷺ) smiled and said: “Move away from me ‘Umar.” When I had argued a great deal with him, he said: “I was given a choice and I made my choice. Had I known that if I were to seek forgiveness for him more than seventy times he would be forgiven, I would have sought it more!” The Messenger (ﷺ) prayed and then left. It was just a short while after that the two verses in Barā’ah (al-Tawbah) came down: “Do not ever pray over anyone of them who dies … died while in a state of contravention”…” [Al-Bukhārī: 1366]."
1316,9,81,"Those who remained behind rejoiced for doing so in defiance of the Messenger of Allah, and disliked to strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives[66], and said, “Do not march forth in this heat[67].” Say, “The Fire of Hell is more intense in heat.” – If only they could understand!","[66] While in reality, Allah had prevented their participation knowing of their hypocrisy and evil intent.
 [67] In the Tabuk Expedition."
1317,9,82,Let them laugh a little and weep a lot as a recompense for what they used to do.,
1318,9,83,"If Allah brings you back to a group of them and they ask your permission to go forth with you, say, “You will never go forth with me, nor will you ever fight an enemy with me. You were content to remain behind the first time, so now stay with those who remained behind[68].”",[68] It is used here to impart a derogatory sense because of their incapacity.

Allah does not let the reward of those who do good to go to waste.","[88] In times of hardship, they should have endured sufferings along with the Prophet (ﷺ) instead of staying behind."
1356,9,121,"Nor do they spend anything [for Allah’s cause], small or large, or cross a valley, but it is recorded for them, so that Allah may give them the best reward for what they used to do.",
1357,9,122,"It is not right for the believers to march forth all at once; a group should go forth to acquire deeper knowledge of the religion, in order to admonish their people when they return to them, so that they may be cautious.",

Allah has turned their hearts away because they are a people who do not understand.","[92] They would exchange glances as if saying to one another: “Who is this person who sees you while you plot in secret and tells Muhammad (ﷺ) about it?” Instead of paying heed, they would turn away reverting to their ways."
1363,9,128,"There has come to you a Messenger from among yourselves; he is grieved by your suffering, and is concerned for you, and is gracious and merciful towards the believers[93].","[93] The Messenger (ﷺ) was keen on guiding people and teaching them all that is good, particularly the believers."

 [5] This is a manifest sign of Allah’s omnipotence, and thus He alone is worthy of worship.

1368,10,4,"To Him is your return altogether. Allah’s promise will surely come true. He originates the creation then brings it back, so that He may justly reward those who believe and do righteous deeds. But for those who disbelieve, there will be a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because of their disbelief.",

1376,10,12,"When hardship befalls man, he calls upon Us, whether lying on his side, sitting or standing. But when We remove his hardship, he turns a blind eye as though he had never called upon Us to remove his hardship[16]. This is how the misdeeds of the transgressors are made appealing to them.","[16] “When We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and distances himself [from Us]; but when evil touches him, he is full of prolonged supplication.” See 41:51."
1377,10,13,"We destroyed the generations[17] before you when they indulged in wrongdoing, and their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they would not believe. This is how We recompense the wicked people.","[17] i.e., the people of Noah, ‘Ād, Thamūd, the people of Abraham, the dwellers of Midian, and the overturned cities [of Lot]” See 9:70."
1378,10,14,Then We made you their successors in the land to see how you would behave[18].,[18] The Messenger (ﷺ) said: “Life is alluringly lush green. Allah will make you successors in it to see what you do” [Muslim: 2742].
1379,10,15,"When Our verses are recited to them clearly, those who do not expect to meet Us say, “Bring us a different Qur’an, or make changes in it[19].” Say, “It is not for me to change it on my own accord; I only follow what is revealed to me. If I were to disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a momentous Day.”","[19] They hated those parts of the Qur’an that did not conform to their erroneous way of life, such as resurrection."
1380,10,16,"Say, “If Allah had willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. I have spent a lifetime[20] among you before this. Do you not then understand?”","[20] i.e., forty years before receiving revelation."
1381,10,17,"Who does greater wrong than he who fabricates lies against Allah or rejects His verses? Indeed, the wicked will never succeed.",

1383,10,19,"The whole of mankind was but a single community, then they differed[21]. If it had not been for a prior decree from your Lord, a decisive judgment would have been passed between them concerning their differences[22].","[21] Ibn ‘Abbās (رضى الله عنهما) reported: “The time between Adam and Noah was ten centuries. Throughout these, people were on the right path of Allah, but then they started disputing [over matters of Faith, i.e., idol worshiping]. So, Allah sent prophets bearing glad tiding and warning”. [Al-Hākim, Al-Mustadrak: 2:546, cf. Al-Tabarī]

1386,10,22,"It is He Who enables you to travel through the land and sea, until when you are in the ships and they sail with those on board and rejoicing in a favorable wind, then suddenly a stormy wind comes, with waves crashing into them on all sides, and they feel that there is no escape. Then they cry out to Allah[24] with sincere devotion to Him, “If You save us from this, we will surely be among those who are grateful.”","[24] The journey of life is vulnerable and precarious, which is analogous to a sea voyage, where people ride and are not sure when the tide will turn against them. It is out of Allah’s grace that keeps them safe from the woes and perils of life."
1387,10,23,"However, when He saves them, they start transgressing in the land unjustly[25]. O people, your transgression is against your own souls. Take your little enjoyment in this life; then to Us is your return, and We will inform you of what you used to do.","[25] By disbelief, associating false deities with Allah and committing sins."
1388,10,24,"The likeness of the life of this world is that of the rain that We send down from the sky, and it mixes with the plants of the earth, from which both humans and livestock eat. Then when the earth is in its splendor and its fairest appearance, and its owners feel that they have full control over it, Our command comes to it, by night or by day, and We reduce it to stubble, as if it had not flourished the day before[26]. This is how We make the signs clear for people who reflect.","[26] The precariousness of life and its transient nature has been depicted beautifully here through potent analogy, so that people may realize that life is nothing but an illusory enjoyment, which will soon come to an abrupt end by death, but the Hereafter is the real and everlasting life."
1389,10,25,Allah invites to the Home of Peace[27] and guides whom He wills to a straight path.,"[27] i.e., Paradise."

1391,10,27,"As for those who commit evil deeds, the recompense of an evil deed is the like thereof, and humiliation will cover them[30] – there will be none to protect them from Allah – as if their faces were covered with patches of the darkest night. It is they who are the people of the Fire, they will abide therein forever.","[30] “On the Day of Resurrection, you will see those who lied against Allah with their faces darkened” See 39:60."
1392,10,28,"On the Day when We gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated partners with Us, “Stay where you are, you and your [so-called] partners!” Then We will separate them, and their partners[31] will say, “It was not us that you used to worship!","[31] i.e., with Allah."

1400,10,36,"Most of them follow nothing but assumptions. However, assumptions are of no avail against the truth. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of what they do.",
1401,10,37,This Qur’an could not possibly have been produced by anyone other than Allah. It is a confirmation of what came before it and an explanation of the Scripture and is undoubtedly from the Lord of the worlds.,

1593,11,120,"We relate to you [O Prophet] the stories of the messengers to strengthen your heart. And there has come to you in this the truth, an admonition and a reminder to the believers.",

1595,11,122,And wait; we too are waiting.”,

1598,12,2,We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an so that you may understand.,
1599,12,3,"We relate to you [O Prophet] the best of stories through Our revelation of this Qur’an, although before this you were unaware of them.",
1600,12,4,"[Remember] when Joseph said to his father[2], “O my father, I saw [in a dream] eleven stars, the sun and the moon – I saw them prostrating to me.”",[2] Prophet Jacob (عليه السلام).
1601,12,5,"He said, “O my son, do not relate your vision to your brothers, lest they devise a plot against you, for Satan is a sworn enemy to mankind.",
1602,12,6,"Thus your Lord will choose you and teach you the interpretation of dreams, and He will complete His favor upon you and upon the house of Jacob, just as He completed it upon your forefathers Abraham and Isaac before. Indeed, your Lord is All-Knowing, All-Wise.”",
1603,12,7,In the story of Joseph and his brothers there are lessons for those who seek [them].,
1604,12,8,"When they said, “Joseph and his brother[3] are dearer to our father than we are, although we are a group of so many. Indeed, our father is clearly mistaken.","[3] His sibling brother Benjamin, while others were his half-brothers from another mother."
1605,12,9,"Kill Joseph or cast him out to another land, so that your father’s attention will only be to you; then you will become righteous people[4].”",[4] By repenting thereafter.
1606,12,10,"One of them said, “Do not kill Joseph; but if you must do something, then throw him into the bottom of the well, so that some travelers may pick him up.”",
1607,12,11,"They said, “O our father, why do you not trust us with Joseph[5], although we truly care for him?","[5] They formulated their challenging scheme carefully, in order to throw their father off guard."
1608,12,12,Send him with us tomorrow so that he may enjoy himself and play; we will surely keep him safe.”,
1609,12,13,"He said, “It truly saddens me that you should take him away, and I fear that a wolf may eat him when you are negligent of him.”",
1610,12,14,"They said, “If a wolf were to eat him, despite our strong group, then we would surely be losers!”",
1611,12,15,"Then when they took him away and they agreed to cast him into the bottom of the well, We inspired him: “You will surely inform them of this affair of theirs when they will not realize [who you are].”",
1612,12,16,"At night they came to their father, crying.",
1613,12,17,"They said, “O our father, we went off racing one another and left Joseph with our belongings, and a wolf ate him. But you will never believe us, no matter how truthful we may be.”",
1614,12,18,"They brought his shirt, stained with false blood[6]. He said, “Nay; rather your souls have enticed you to commit something. But I will bear it with beautiful patience. It is Allah’s help that I seek against what you claim.”",[6] They had stained Joseph's shirt with the blood of a lamb but had forgotten to tear it; a sure sign of their lying.
1615,12,19,"Some travelers came and sent their water fetcher, who lowered his bucket into the well. He cried out, “Oh, what good news; here is a boy!” They kept him hidden as merchandise[7], but Allah is All-Knowing of what they did.",[7] To be sold as a slave.
1616,12,20,"They sold him for a meager price, a few silver coins; they were quite indifferent about him[8].","[8] i.e., his brothers sold him to the caravan for a pittance, or the wayfarers sold him in Egypt and were unaware of his true worth."
1617,12,21,"The man[9] in Egypt who bought him said to his wife, “Make his stay comfortable; perhaps he will benefit us or we may adopt him as a son.” This is how We established Joseph in the land, so that We may teach him the interpretation of dreams. Allah’s decree always prevails, but most people do not know.",[9] The minister whose title was al-‘Azīz.
1618,12,22,"When he reached his prime, We gave him wisdom[10] and knowledge. This is how We reward those who do good.","[10] i.e., sound judgment or prophethood."
1619,12,23,"But the woman[11] in whose house he was living tried to seduce him. She bolted the doors and said, “Come here to me!” He said, “I seek refuge with Allah! My master has made my stay good. Indeed, the wrongdoers will never succeed.”","[11] i.e., the wife of the minister."
1620,12,24,"She advanced towards him, and he would have advanced towards her, had he not seen a sign from his Lord. This is how We kept evil and shameful acts away from him. Indeed, he was one of Our chosen slaves.",
1621,12,25,"They both rushed to the door and she tore his shirt from behind, and they found her husband at the door. She said, “What is the punishment for someone who tried to dishonor your wife, except to be imprisoned or a painful punishment?”",
1622,12,26,"Joseph said, “It was she who tried to seduce me.” A witness from her own household suggested: “If his shirt is torn from the front, then she is telling the truth and he is a liar.",
1623,12,27,"But if his shirt is torn from the back, then she is lying and he is truthful.”",
1624,12,28,"When he saw that his shirt was torn from the back, he said, “This is your guile [O women]; your guile is great indeed!",
1625,12,29,"O Joseph, forget about this; but you [O wife], seek forgiveness for your sin, for it was you who have done wrong.”",
1626,12,30,"Some women in the city said, “The chief minister’s wife is trying to seduce her slave-boy; his love has overwhelmed her heart. We see that she is clearly mistaken.”",
1627,12,31,"When she heard of their gossip, she invited them and arranged for them a banquet, gave each one of them a knife, and said [to Joseph], “Come out before them.” When they saw him, they were so stunned[12] that they cut their hands, and said, “Great God! This cannot be human; this must be a noble angel.”","[12] In the long Hadith of the Nocturnal Journey and Ascension (al-isrā’ wa al-mi‘rāj), Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) described Prophet Joseph (عليه السلام) when he met him as a man who is “Endowed with half of all human handsomeness.” [cf. Muslim: 162]"
1628,12,32,"She said, “This is the one for whose love you reproached me. I did try to seduce him but he abstained. If he does not follow my order, he will surely be imprisoned and will be fully humiliated.”",
1629,12,33,"Joseph said, “My Lord, I would rather be in prison than that to which they are calling me. Unless you protect me from their guile, I may succumb to them and fall into ignorance.”",
1630,12,34,"So his Lord answered his prayer and protected him from their guile. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",
1631,12,35,Then it occurred to them after they saw the signs [of his innocence] that they should imprison him for some time[13].,[13] so that the scandal be forgotten.
1632,12,36,"Two young men went to prison with him. One of them said, “I dreamt that I was pressing wine.” The other said, “I dreamt that I was carrying bread on my head of which birds were eating. Tell us their interpretation[14], for we see you as one of those who do good.”",[14] Interpretation of the dreams of his jail mates was the reason behind his victorious release and appointment as Chief Minister.
1633,12,37,"Joseph said, “Before there comes to you the meal which you will be given, I will inform you of their interpretation. This is part of what my Lord has taught me. I have renounced the faith of people who do not believe in Allah and who deny the Hereafter.",
1634,12,38,"I follow the faith of my fathers – Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; it is not right for us to associate any partner with Allah. This is from Allah’s favor upon us and upon people, but most people are ungrateful.",
1635,12,39,"O my two fellow prisoners, which is better: many different lords or Allah, the One, the Subjugator?",
1636,12,40,"You worship none besides Him except names that you and your forefathers have made up, for which Allah has not sent down any authority. All power belongs to Allah alone; He has commanded that you should worship none except Him[15]. This is the right religion, but most people do not know.”",[15] Peoples’ sheer ignorance leads to associating partners with Allah.
1637,12,41,"“O my two fellow prisoners, as for one of you, he will serve wine to his master[16]; as for the other, he will be crucified and the birds will eat from his head. The matter you are asking about has been decreed.”","[16] i.e., the king."
1638,12,42,"Then he said to the one he knew would be saved, “Mention me to your master.” But Satan made him forget to mention this to his master, so he remained in prison for several years.",
1639,12,43,"The King said, “I dreamt of seven fat cows eaten up by seven lean ones, and seven green ears of grain and [seven] others withered. O chiefs, explain my dream to me if you can interpret dreams.”",
1640,12,44,"They said, “These are jumbled dreams, and we do not know the interpretation of such dreams.”",
1641,12,45,"The freed prisoner remembered after a long time had passed, and said, “I will inform you of its interpretation, so send me forth.”",
1642,12,46,"[He said], “Joseph, O man of truth, tell us about seven fat cows eaten up by seven lean ones, and seven green ears of grain and [seven] others withered, so that I may return to the people and that they may know.”",
1643,12,47,"Joseph said, “You will grow crops for seven consecutive years. But whatever you harvest, leave it in its ear, except for a little that you may eat.",
1644,12,48,"Then after that will come seven years of hardship which will devour all what you had stored, except for a little that you may set aside[17].",[17] In their granaries.
1645,12,49,"Then after that will come a year in which people will have abundant rain, and in which they will press [grapes and olives].”",
1646,12,50,"The King said, “Bring him to me[18].” But when the messenger came to him, he said, “Go back to your master and ask him, ‘What was the case of the women who cut their hands?’ Indeed, my Lord is All-Knowing of their guile.”","[18] To underline Joseph’s fortitude, Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said: “Had I stayed in jail as long as Yūsuf did, I would have answered the caller!” [Al-Bukhārī:3372, Muslim:151]. Understandably, any person in Yūsuf’s most desperate position would have rushed out at the first opportunity. Yet he wanted the end of his imprisonment on favorable grounds and to prove his innocence."
1647,12,51,"The king said, “What happened when you [O women] tried to seduce Joseph?” They said, “Allah forbid; we know nothing bad about him.” The chief minister’s wife said, “Now the truth has come to light. It was I who tried to seduce him, and he is surely the truthful.",
1648,12,52,"That is because he [i.e., the chief] should know that I did not betray him in his absence, for Allah does not lead the guile of the betrayers to succeed.”",
1649,12,53,"I[19] do not absolve myself of blame, for Indeed the soul prompts one to evil, except those to whom my Lord may show mercy. Indeed, my Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”","[19] i.e., the wife of al-‘Azeez."
1650,12,54,"The King said, “Bring him to me; I will appoint him [as an adviser] exclusively to myself.” Then when he spoke to him, he said, “You are today in a highly-esteemed position and fully trusted by us.”",
1651,12,55,"Joseph said, “Put me in charge of the storehouses of the land[20]; I am indeed a good keeper and knowledgeable[21].”","[20] He found himself in a better position than anyone else for those difficult days ahead, so he offered his services. [21] The two most needed traits in a treasurer."
1652,12,56,"This is how We established Joseph in the land[22] so that he may settle wherever he wished. We extend Our mercy to whom We will, and We do not let the reward of those who do good to go to waste.",[22] This is the final episode in Joseph’s journey to greatness. The first was becoming a member of the Chief Minister’s household in his tender years (verse 21 above).
1653,12,57,But the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and fear Allah.,
1654,12,58,The brothers of Joseph came and presented themselves before him; he recognized them but they did not know him.,
1655,12,59,"When he prepared for them their rations, he said, “Bring me your step-brother[23]; do you not see that I give full measure and I am the best host?","[23] i.e., Benjamin."
1656,12,60,"If you do not bring him to me, you will never receive any measure [of grain] from me, nor will you even come close to me.”",
1657,12,61,"They said, “We will persuade his father to send him[24], and we will surely do our best.”","[24] They knew its difficulty, but they still made a promise."
1658,12,62,"Joseph said to his servants, “Put their trading goods back in their saddlebags so that they may find them when they go back to their family; perhaps they will return.”",
1659,12,63,"When they returned to their father, they said, “O our father, we have been denied any further measure [of grain]; send our brother with us so that we may receive our measure, and we will surely protect him.”",
1660,12,64,"He said, “Should I trust you with him as I trusted you earlier with his brother[25]? But Allah is the best Protector, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.”",[25] Saying this is an indication of a softer position taken by Jacob on the issue.
1661,12,65,"When they opened their baggage, they found that their merchandise had been returned to them. They said, “O our father, what more could we ask for? Here are our trading goods returned to us. We can bring more food to our family, protect our brother, and obtain an extra camel-load of grain[26]. That measure is easily secured.”",[26] They mentioned this to cajole their father of their good intentions.
1662,12,66,"He said, “I will never send him with you unless you give me a pledge by Allah that you will surely bring him back to me, unless you are completely overpowered.” Then when they gave him their pledge, he said, “Allah is Witness to what we say.”",
1663,12,67,"And he said, “O my sons, do not enter all from one gate, but enter from different gates[27]. I cannot avail you anything against [the decree of] Allah; the decision belongs to Allah alone. In Him I put my trust, and in Him let the faithful put their trust.”","[27] There is an edifying note here. Besides putting trust in Allah, one needs to take precautions."
1664,12,68,"When they entered as their father had instructed them, it could not avail them against [the decree of] Allah whatsoever, yet a need in Jacob’s heart was satisfied. He was indeed a man of knowledge because of what We had taught him, but most people do not know.",
1665,12,69,"When they came into Joseph’s presence, he called his brother [Benjamin] aside, and said, “I am indeed your brother, so do not be saddened by their past actions.”",
1666,12,70,"When he prepared for them their rations, he placed the [royal] drinking vessel in his brother’s saddlebag. Then an announcer called out, “O people of the caravan, you must be thieves!”",
1667,12,71,"They said as they turned back, “What are you missing?”",
1668,12,72,"They said, “We are missing the king’s measuring cup. Whoever brings it will have a camel-load [of grain]; and I guarantee it.”",
1669,12,73,"They said, “By Allah, you know well that we did not come to spread corruption in the land, nor are we thieves.”",
1670,12,74,"They said, “What should the punishment be[28], if you are liars?”",[28] The punishment for theft.
1671,12,75,"They said, “The punishment is that the one in whose saddlebag it is found should be enslaved in recompense. This is how we punish the wrongdoers.”",
1672,12,76,"So he began searching their bags before his brother’s bag[29], then he brought it out of his brother’s bag. This is how We planned for Joseph; he could not have detained his brother under the King’s law, unless Allah so willed. We raise in ranks whom We will, but above each one who possesses knowledge is the All-Knowing One.",[29] To avert suspicion.
1673,12,77,"They said, “If he steals, then it was his brother [Joseph] who stole before.” Joseph kept it to himself and did not reveal it to them, and said [in his heart], “You are in a far worse position; and Allah knows best the truth of what you say.”",
1674,12,78,"They said, “O chief minister, he has an elderly and vulnerable father, so take one of us instead of him, for we see that you are a kind man.”",
1675,12,79,"Joseph said, “Allah forbid that we should take except the one with whom we found our property, for we would then be unjust.”",
1676,12,80,"When they lost hope in him, they conferred privately. The eldest of them said, “Do you not know that your father has taken from you a solemn pledge by Allah, and before this you failed with regard to Joseph? Therefore, I will never leave this land until my father gives me permission[30] or Allah decides for me, for He is the Best of Judges.",[30] Alluding to their father that this situation was different from Joseph’s.
1677,12,81,"Go back to your father and say, ‘O our father, your son has committed theft, and we did not tell you except what we saw, and we had no knowledge of the unseen[31].","[31] i.e., we had not known that he would steal when we gave you the oath."
1678,12,82,"Ask [the people of] the town where we were and the caravan we came with, and we are surely telling the truth.”",
1679,12,83,"He said, “No, but your souls have enticed you to commit something. But I will bear this with beautiful patience; perhaps Allah will bring them all[32] back to me, for He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”","[32] i.e., his three missing sons."
1680,12,84,"He turned away from them and said, “O my sorrow for Joseph!” And his eyes turned white[33] because of suppressing his grief.","[33] i.e., he lost his sight."
1681,12,85,"They said, “By Allah, you will not cease to remember Joseph until your health is ruined or you die.”",
1682,12,86,"He said, “I only complain of my anguish and sorrow to Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know.",
1683,12,87,"O my sons, go and find out[34] about Joseph and his brother, and do not despair of Allah’s mercy. Indeed, no one despairs of Allah’s mercy except the disbelieving people.”",[34] Tahassasū (lit. grope): to be extra vigilant in the search for them.
1684,12,88,"When they came into Joseph’s presence, they said, “O chief minister, we and our family have been struck with adversity, and we have brought some goods of scanty worth. So give us full measure [of grain] and be charitable to us, for Allah rewards those who are charitable.”",
1685,12,89,"He said, “Do you know what you did to Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant[35]?”",[35] He provided them with a face-saving excuse by saying that they were ignorant for what they did.
1686,12,90,"They said, “Are you really Joseph?” He said, “I am Joseph, and this is my brother. Allah has surely been gracious to us[36]. Whoever fears Allah and remains patient, Allah will not let the reward of those who do good to go to waste.”",[36] Joseph made the point that he and also his brother underwent a good turn of fortune after oppression.
1687,12,91,"They said, “By Allah, Allah has favored you[37] over us, and we have surely been sinful.”","[37] Finally, they admitted that he was the ‘favored one’."
1688,12,92,"He said, “There is no blame on you today. May Allah forgive you, for He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.",
1689,12,93,Take this shirt of mine and throw it over my father’s face; he will recover his sight. Then come back to me with all of your family.”,
1690,12,94,"When the caravan set out [from Egypt], their father said, “I certainly sense the fragrance of Joseph, even though you might think that I am senile.”",
1691,12,95,"They said, “By Allah, you are still lost in your old delusion.”",
1692,12,96,"Then when the bearer of the glad tidings came, he threw it[38] over his face, and he immediately recovered his sight. He said, “Did I not tell you that I know from Allah what you do not know?”","[38] i.e., Joseph's shirt."
1693,12,97,"They said, “O our father, pray to Allah to forgive us our sins; we were certainly mistaken.”",
1694,12,98,"He said, “I will ask my Lord to forgive you, for He is the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.”",
1695,12,99,"When they came into Joseph’s presence, he embraced his parents and said, “Enter Egypt, if Allah wills, safe and secure.",
1696,12,100,"He took his parents to the throne, and they all fell down in prostration[39] before him. He said, “O my father, this is the interpretation of my old dream. My Lord has made it come true. He was kind to me when He freed me from prison and brought you all here from the wilderness after Satan caused a rift between me and my brothers. My Lord is gracious to whom He wills. Indeed, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”","[39] That of greeting and respect, not of worship, which was permissible before the time of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)."
1697,12,101,"“My Lord, You have given me authority and taught me something of the interpretation of dreams. O Originator of the heavens and earth, You are my Protector in this world and in the Hereafter. Cause me to die as a Muslim [submitting to You], and join me with the righteous[40].”",[40] By the ‘righteous’ ones Joseph meant his forefathers Isaac and Abraham and all other prophets and messengers.
1698,12,102,That is from the stories of the unseen which We reveal to you [O Prophet]; you were not with them when they agreed upon their plan as they were plotting.,
1699,12,103,"But most people will not believe, no matter how eager you may be.",
1700,12,104,You are not asking them for any reward. It is only a reminder to the worlds.,
1701,12,105,How many signs there are in the heavens and earth which they pass by without paying them any heed!,
1702,12,106,And most of them do not believe in Allah except that they associate partners with Him.,
1703,12,107,"Do they feel secure that an overwhelming punishment from Allah will not overtake them, or that the Hour will not come upon them by surprise when they least expect it?",
1704,12,108,"Say [O Prophet], “This is my way. I call to Allah with clear evidence – I and those who follow me. Glory be to Allah, and I am not one of those who associate partners with Him.”",
1705,12,109,"We did not send before you[41] except men whom We gave a revelation, from the people of each society. Have they not traveled through the land to see how was the end of those who came before them? But the home of the Hereafter is far better for those who fear Allah. Do you not then understand?","[41] i.e., Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)."
1706,12,110,"Until when the messengers lost all hope and realized that they were dismissed as liars, Our help came to them, so We saved whom We willed, and Our punishment cannot be averted from the wicked people.",
1707,12,111,"In their stories there is truly a lesson for people of understanding. This [Qur’an] is not a fabricated tale, rather a confirmation of what came before it, a detailed explanation of everything, a guidance and mercy for people who believe.",
1708,13,1,"Alif Lām Mīm Ra[1]. These are the verses of the Book. That which has been sent down to you [O Prophet] from your Lord is the truth, but most people do not believe.",[1] See footnote 2:1.
1709,13,2,"It is Allah Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see, and then He rose over the Throne[2]. He subjected the sun and the moon, each running its course for an appointed term. He governs all affairs, and explains the signs in detail, so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.",[2] See footnote 7:54.
1710,13,3,"It is He Who spread out the earth and placed therein firm mountains and rivers, and created therein fruits of every kind in pairs. He causes the night to cover the day. Indeed, there are signs in this for people who reflect.",
1711,13,4,"And on the earth there are neighboring [yet different] tracts of land, and gardens of grapevines, grains and palm trees – some growing in clusters from one root or standing alone. They are all irrigated with the same water, yet We cause some of them to excel others in taste. Indeed, there are signs in this for people of understanding.",
1712,13,5,"If you wonder, then wondrous is their saying, “What! When we become dust, will we be created anew?” They are the ones who disbelieve in their Lord, and they are the ones who will have shackles around their necks. Such are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.",
1713,13,6,"They ask you [O Prophet] to hasten the punishment before the good[3], even though there have already been similar punishments before them. But your Lord is indeed forgiving to people despite their wrongdoing, and your Lord is indeed severe in punishment.",[3] This shows the utter disregard towards the Message.
1714,13,7,"The disbelievers say, “Why has no sign[4] been sent down to him from his Lord?” You are only a warner, and for every people there is a guide.","[4] i.e., a miracle."
1715,13,8,"Allah knows what every female bears[5], and what the wombs may fall short or increase[6]. With Him everything is precisely measured.","[5] Human and otherwise, during pregnancy.

1718,13,11,"For each person there are successive angels[7] in front of him and behind him, guarding him by the command of Allah. Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own attitude and conduct[8]. But if Allah intends punishment for a people[9], then it cannot be averted, nor will there be any protector for them besides Him.","[7] Angels tasked with each human; they alternate and take day and night shifts.
 [8] As long as people acknowledge Allah’s grace on them and are grateful to Him, He will not show them other than mercy, and vice versa. If they persist in disobedience, then let them not be fooled by the respite they are given, for Allah’s command can come at any moment.

1721,13,14,"To Him alone should all supplication be addressed[12]. But those whom they supplicate besides Him do not respond to them in any way, except like one who stretches out his hands for water to reach his mouth, but it will never reach it[13]. The supplication of the disbelievers is all in vain.","[12] i.e., the testimony of faith (There is no true god but Allah).
 [13] The analogy indicates that false deities will never respond to them."
1722,13,15,"To Allah prostrates[14] whoever is in the heavens and on earth, willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the morning and evening.",[14] There are two types of prostrations: sujūd shar‘i (Intentional prostration) and sujūd qadari (Unintentional prostration). See also 3:83.

Say, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Subjugator.”","[15] The claimed partners cannot be compared to Allah in any way.
 [16] Disbelievers are ‘blind’ to the Truth and the believers can see the Truth plainly as it is.

1724,13,17,"He sends down rain from the sky, causing the valleys to flow, each according to its capacity, and the torrent carries along rising foam, similar to the slag produced from metal that people melt in the fire to make ornaments or tools. This is how Allah compares truth to falsehood: as for the residue, it is then cast away, but that which benefits people remains on the earth[18]. This is how Allah sets forth comparisons.","[18] Truth is the water that stays and people benefit from it, whereas falsehood is the scum that soon dissolves and disappears; likewise is the slag of minerals."
1725,13,18,"Those who respond to their Lord will have the best reward[19]. As for those who do not respond to Him, even if they were to possess all that is on earth and the likes thereof, they would surely offer it to ransom themselves; they will have the worst reckoning[20], and their abode will be Hell. What a terrible resting place!","[19] al-Husnā (lit. the best reward) is a good reward in this life and Paradise in the Hereafter.

1732,13,25,"As for those who break the covenant of Allah after it has been ratified, and sever the ties that Allah has commanded to be maintained, and spread corruption in the land – it is they who are cursed, and for them there will be the worst abode[24].","[24] i.e., Hell."
1733,13,26,"Allah extends provision to whom He wills or restricts it. They rejoice in the life of this world, although the life of this world, compared to the Hereafter, is nothing but a fleeting pleasure.",

1738,13,31,"Even if there were a Qur’an that could cause mountains to move[26], or split the earth, or cause the dead to speak, [they would still not believe]. To Allah belongs all matters. Do the believers not know that if Allah had willed, He could have guided all humans? Calamities will continue to befall the disbelievers or strike close to their homes because of their deeds, until the promise of Allah comes to pass, for Allah does not fail in His promise.","[26] “Had We sent down this Qur’an upon a mountain, you would have seen it humbled and break asunder out of awe of Allah!” See 59:21."
1739,13,32,"There were messengers before you who were ridiculed, but I gave respite to those who disbelieved, then I seized them[27]. How [terrible] was My chastisement!",[27] This is a comforting note to the Prophet (ﷺ).
1740,13,33,"Is He Who watches every soul in whatever it does [like others]? Yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say, “Name them! Or do you presume to inform Him of something that He does not know on earth, or it is just a show of words?” No, but the falsehood of the disbelievers is made appealing to them, and they are hindered from the [straight] path.

1745,13,38,We have sent messengers before you and gave them wives and offspring[30]. It was not for any messenger to bring a sign except with Allah’s permission. Every matter has a destined time.,"[30] These are the basic human needs, for Messengers are human beings, not angelic beings."
1746,13,39,"Allah eliminates what He wills or affirms it[31], and with Him is the Master Book[32].","[31] Although everything is set in the Record, He decrees whatever He wishes and the angels erase or affirm in the scrolls whatever He dictates.

1754,14,4,"We did not send any messenger but in the language of his people to make things clear for them. Allah causes to stray whom He wills[3] and guides whom He wills, and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.","[3] i.e., those who refuse His guidance."
1755,14,5,"We sent Moses with Our signs [saying], “Bring your people out of the depths of darkness into the light, and remind them of Allah’s days[4].

Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they shoved their hands into their mouths[5] and said, “We disbelieve in what you are sent with, and we surely doubt what you are calling us to.”",[5] as a gesture of denial and rejection.
1760,14,10,"Their messengers said, “Can there be any doubt about Allah, the Creator of the heavens and earth? He calls you so that He may forgive some of your sins, and give you respite for an appointed term.” They said, “You are but humans like us!

1763,14,13,"The disbelievers said to their messengers, “We will surely drive you out of our land unless you return to our religion.” Their Lord then inspired them, “We will certainly destroy the wrongdoers,",

1777,14,27,Allah keeps those who believe steadfast with the firm Word [of faith] in the life of this world[18] and in the Hereafter. But Allah causes to stray the wrongdoers[19]; Allah does whatever He wills.,"[18] When questioned in their graves by the angels.

1778,14,28,"Did you not see those who exchanged Allah’s blessings with disbelief[20], and led their people to the abode of ruin[21]?","[20] They met Allah’s blessings with denial instead of gratitude.

1782,14,32,"It is Allah Who has created the heavens and earth and sent down rain from the sky, producing therewith fruits as provision for you. He has made the ships for your service to sail through the sea by His command and has made for you the rivers.",

1856,15,54,"He said, “Do you give me glad tidings despite my old age? What glad tidings are you giving me?”",
1857,15,55,"They said, “We have given you glad tidings in truth, so do not be of those who despair[25].”",[25] Abraham (عليه السلام) might have shown signs of doubt at believing such news.
1858,15,56,"He said, “Who would despair of his Lord’s mercy except those who are misguided[26]?”",[26] Abraham’s (عليه السلام) reply disproves the assumption that he was despondent of Allah’s Mercy.
1859,15,57,"He said, “So, what is your mission, O messengers?”",
1860,15,58,"They said, “We have been sent to a wicked people[27],","[27] i.e., the people of the prophet Lot (عليه السلام)."

1862,15,60,except his wife[28]; We have decreed that she will be among those who stay behind.”,[28] For she has collaborated with the evildoers.
1863,15,61,"When the messengers came to the household of Lot[29],","[29] Details of the first three nations destroyed are given in this and the following verses, which were en route of the famous trading journeys of the Qurayshites: the people of Prophet Lot, those of the thicket (the people of Shu‘ayb), and those of Hegra (Madā’in Sālih)."
1864,15,62,"he said, “You are unfamiliar people.”",

1869,15,67,The people of the city came [to Lot] rejoicing[32].,[32] At the news of his visitors.
1870,15,68,"Lot said, “These are my guests, so do not bring shame on me.",

1876,15,74,and We turned their cities upside down[35] and rained down on them stones of baked clay.,"[35] Their nature was twisted, so their punishment was of its like."

1878,15,76,And their place is located by a known route[37].,"[37] i.e., on the highway to the Levant, where the Dead Sea is now."
1879,15,77,"Indeed, there are signs in this for the believers.",

1881,15,79,"So We punished them in retribution, and both [places][39] are by a clear highway.","[39] i.e., both the dwellings of the people of Prophet Lot (عليه السلام) and Prophet Shu‘ayb (عليه السلام)."
1882,15,80,Surely the people of Al-Hijr[40] also rejected the messengers.,"[40] i.e., Thamūd: the people of Prophet Sālih (عليه السلام)."
1883,15,81,"We gave them Our signs, but they kept turning away from them.",
1884,15,82,"They carved houses in the mountains, feeling secure[41].",[41] These mountainous strongholds gave them a false sense of security against any consequences.

1886,15,84,Nothing of what they earned was of any avail to them.,
1887,15,85,"We have not created the heavens and earth and all that is between them except for a true purpose. The Hour is certainly coming, so bear with them graciously[42].","[42] This final passage puts things into perspective, addressing the Prophet (ﷺ) - that all people, including those who tormented him, will be justly held accountable for their deeds, and asking him to overlook their taunts and not censure them for it."
1888,15,86,"Indeed, your Lord is the Absolute Creator, the All-Knowing.",
1889,15,87,We have surely given you the seven oft-repeated verses[43] and the great Qur’an.,"[43] i.e., Seven of al-Mathāni (seven repeatedly recited verses), referring to Surat al-Fātihah."

 [47] The favor of the Qur’an far surpasses all other favors and worldly gains."
1891,15,89,"And say, “I am indeed a clear warner.” –",

 [2] Shirk (associating partners with Allah) is the most egregious of all sins, as He warned against it right after mentioning the imminence of the Hour. Allah stresses against Shirk or calls for pure Tawhīd (monotheism) in the two subsequent verses as well."
1903,16,2,"He sends down the angels with revelation by His command to whom He wills of His slaves, [saying], “Warn that none has the right to be worshiped except Me, so fear Me.”",
1904,16,3,He created the heavens and earth for a true purpose. Exalted is He far above what they associate with Him!,
1905,16,4,"He created man from a sperm-drop, and then he becomes a clear adversary[3].","[3] As soon as he becomes strong and independent. The ones who are meant here are, especially, the disbelievers who deny resurrection, argue against the Truth, and are ungrateful to Allah’s favors."

2104,17,75,"In that case, We would have made you taste double punishment, both in this life and after death. Thereupon you would have found no helper against Us.",
2105,17,76,"They were about to provoke you so as to drive you out of the land [of Makkah], but then they would not have remained after you, except for a little while[67].",[67] Makkah was completely cleared of the Prophet's enemies only ten years after his emigration.

2110,17,81,"And say, “The truth has come and falsehood has perished. Indeed, falsehood is bound to perish[73].”","[73] Abdullāh Ibn Mas‘ūd (رضي الله عنه) narrated that: “The Prophet (ﷺ) entered Makkah on the day of its conquest, and there were around 360 idols around the Ka‘bah. He went on thrusting them with a stick in his hand making them tumble down and saying: “The Truth has come and falsehood has perished...” [al-Bukhārī: 87; Muslim: 1781]"
2111,17,82,"We send down the Qur’an as a healing and mercy[74] for the believers, but it does not increase the wrongdoers except in loss.","[74] Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī (رضي الله عنه) reported that: “Some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) set out on a journey and they passed by an Arabian tribe. The chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake. They went to them and sought their help. A person amongst us said: “I shall treat him with ruqyah (incantation). But I shall not treat him unless you reward us. We asked you for your hospitality and you refused!” They agreed to give us a herd of goats. So he went to him and recited Surat al-Fātihah and blew over him. The chief was invigorated and went on walking with no sign of ailment. They gave them the agreed reward. Some of the Companions said: “Let us divide it!” Others said: “Do not, until you reach the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), tell him what has happened and see what he bids us do”. They went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and told him. He said: “How did you come to know that it can be used as ruqyah? You have done the right thing. Divide it and allocate a share for me” [al-Bukhārī: 5749; Muslim: 2201]. ‘Ā’ishah (رضي الله عنه) narrated that: “When ill, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to recite al-Mu‘awwidhāt (the Sheltering surahs, al-Falaq and al-Nās) and blow. When his sickness got worse, I used to recite them over him and rub his body with his own hand seeking its blessing” [Al-Bukhārī: 5016; Muslim: 2192]."
2112,17,83,"When We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and distances himself, but when evil befalls him, he is in utter despair.",
2113,17,84,"Say, “Everyone acts in his own way[75], but your Lord knows best whose way is best guided.”","[75] Say to them O Prophet, continue in your way of disbelief, with which you are satisfied; I will continue with my path of guidance."
2114,17,85,"They ask you [O Prophet] about the spirit[76]. Say, “The soul is only known to my Lord, and you have not been given knowledge except a little.”","[76] i.e., the spirit that sustains life in the body or the Archangel Gabriel."
2115,17,86,"If We willed, We could surely take away what We have revealed to you, then you would find no guardian to plead its return from Us;",
2116,17,87,"nevertheless it is a mercy from your Lord[77], for His favor to you is truly great.","[77] Allah would not take away the Qur’an, out of mercy to His Prophet and to His servants."
2117,17,88,"Say, “If all humans and jinn were to come together to produce something similar to this Qur’an, they would not be able to produce the like of it, even if they collaborated with one another[78].”",[78] The miraculousness of the Qur’an and its inimitability lie in both its word and meaning.
2118,17,89,"We have explained every kind of example[79] for mankind in this Qur’an, yet most people persist in disbelief.","[79] i.e., proofs, admonitions, similitudes, and stories, so that people of sound reason may take heed."
2119,17,90,"They say, “We will never believe in you until you cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth[80],","[80] Showing miracles are of no use, even if it is catastrophic to them."
2120,17,91,"or until you have a garden of date palms and grapevines, and you cause rivers to flow abundantly in their midst,",
2121,17,92,"or you make the sky to fall upon us in pieces – as you claim – or bring Allah and the angels before us face to face,",
2122,17,93,"or until you have a house of gold, or you ascend to heaven, and even then we will never believe in your ascension unless you bring down to us a book which we can read.” Say, “Glory be to my Lord! Am I anything but a human, sent as a messenger?”",
2123,17,94,"Nothing prevented people from believing when guidance came to them except that they said, “Has Allah sent a human as a messenger?”",

2126,17,97,"Whoever Allah guides is truly guided; and whoever He causes to stray, you will find none to protect them besides Him. On the Day of Resurrection, We will gather [and drag] them on their faces – deaf, dumb and blind. Their abode will be Hell; every time it subsides, We will flare it up for them[81].",[81] As a consequence of his own preference.

2130,17,101,"We gave Moses nine clear signs. Ask the Children of Israel when he came to them, Pharaoh said to him, “O Moses, I certainly think that you are bewitched[82].”",[82] Makkans are warned by his example not to hasten their punishment by asking for miracles that they would not believe.
2131,17,102,"Moses said, “You already know that none sent down these [signs] except the Lord of the heavens and earth as clear proofs, and I certainly think that you, O Pharaoh, are doomed!”",
2132,17,103,"So he decided to exile them out of the land, but We drowned him and all those who were with him.",
2133,17,104,"Thereafter[83] We said to the Children of Israel, “Dwell in the land, but when the promise of the Hereafter comes, We will bring you all together.”",[83] After the drowning of Pharaoh and his people.
2134,17,105,"With the truth We have sent down this [Qur’an] and with the truth it has descended[84], and We have not sent you [O Prophet] except as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner.","[84] It is repeated twice in the face of the ardent denial of the pagans of Makkah and their demand to provide them with miracles, asserting here that the Qur’an is a revelation from Allah: it contains truthful news and just rulings, as it is sent down by Gabriel (عليه السلام), the strong and trustworthy, to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), safeguarded against the devils, free from alteration, additions or omission, throughout all times."
2135,17,106,"This is a Qur’an that We have revealed over stages so that you may recite it to people at a slower pace, and We have sent it down in a successive manner[85].","[85] In separate segments, one coming after another over the duration of 23 years of his mission."
2136,17,107,"Say, “Believe in it, or do not believe. Those who were given knowledge before it[86], when it is recited to them, they fall on their faces in prostration,",[86] Of the People of the Book who recognize the truth.

2138,17,109,"They fall down on their faces weeping, and it increases their humility.”",
2139,17,110,"Say, “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Compassionate[87] – whichever name you call, to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names.” Do not be too loud in your prayer, nor too quiet, but seek a way in between[88].","[87] The Makkans heard the Prophet (ﷺ) praying to Allah, once as Allah and on another occasion as Al-Rahmān, and claimed that he was praying to two different gods. [Majmū‘ al-Fatāwā, Ibn Taymiyyah, 14:15] Both are two Names for Allah, the One and Only God.
 [88] Abdullāh ibn Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) reported the reason behind the revelation of this verse: “It came down when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was lying low in Makkah. When he used to lead his Companions in Prayer and raise his voice and the pagans heard him, they would curse the Qur’an and He Who sent it down. So Allah said to His Messenger: “Do not raise your voice is Prayer upon which the pagans would hear you, yet not too quiet that your Companions may not hear you. Make them hear the Qur’an but do not raise your voice to that extent; seeking a middle way between them.” [Al-Bukhārī: 4722; Muslim: 446]."
2140,17,111,"And say, “All praise is for Allah Who has not taken a son, nor does He have any partner in His dominion, nor does He need any protector out of weakness. And proclaim His greatness immensely.”",
2141,18,1,"All praise be to Allah Who has sent down upon His slave the Book, and has not allowed any crookedness therein[1],",[1] From the straight path or from the truth.
2142,18,2,"an upright Book, to warn of severe punishment from Him[2], and to give glad tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds, that they will have a good reward,","[2] i.e., a painful punishment that awaits them in the Hereafter, and in this life such as in the battle at the hands of the believers."
2143,18,3,wherein they will abide forever;,
2144,18,4,"and to warn those who say, “Allah has begotten a son[3].”","[3] Such as the Jews and Christians, and the Arab pagans who claimed that angels are Allah’s daughters."
2145,18,5,"They have no knowledge of it, nor did their forefathers[4]. What a monstrous word that comes out of their mouths! They say nothing but lies.",[4] Of the reality of their false claims about Him.
2146,18,6,Perhaps you will grieve yourself to death [O Prophet] over them[5] if they do not believe in this message[6].,"[5] To the extent of almost wasting yourself away.
 [6] i.e., the Qur’an."
2147,18,7,"We have made all that is on earth as an adornment for it, so that We may test them as to which of them is best in deeds.",
2148,18,8,And We will surely turn all that is on it into a barren land[7].,"[7] It shows the transient nature of life in this world, so one should invest in it for what comes after death."
2149,18,9,Do you think that the people of the Cave and the Inscription were of Our only wondrous signs[8]?,"[8] Rather, there are many other wonders of Allah such as the creation of heavens and earth."
2150,18,10,"When the youths took refuge in the Cave, and said, “Our Lord, grant us mercy from Yourself, and show us the right way in our ordeal[9].”","[9] The youths have sought refuge in the cave for the sake of their religion, so they asked Allah to keep them firm on the straight path."
2151,18,11,Then We caused them to fall into a deep sleep in the cave for many years.,
2152,18,12,Then We awakened them so that We may see which of the two parties would be more precise in calculating the length of their stay.,
2153,18,13,"We relate to you their story in truth. They were youths who believed in their Lord, and We gave them more guidance.",
2154,18,14,"We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and proclaimed, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and earth. We will never call upon any god other than Him, or we would be uttering an outrageous lie[10].”","[10] i.e., too far away from the Truth."
2155,18,15,These people of ours have taken besides Him other gods. Why do they not bring clear proof about them? Who does greater wrong than one who fabricates lies against Allah?,
2156,18,16,"When you have distanced yourselves from them and what they worship other than Allah, take refuge in the cave; your Lord will extend His mercy to you and make for you an easy way out of your ordeal.”",
2157,18,17,"You would have seen the sun when it rose, it would incline away from their Cave to the right; and when it set, it would turn away from them to the left[11], while they were in its open space. That was one of the signs of Allah. Whoever Allah guides is rightly guided, and whoever He causes to stray, you will never find for him a protecting guide.",[11] As such they would get all the air and ventilation they needed to sustain.
2158,18,18,"You would have thought they were awake, although they were asleep. We turned them over on their right and left sides, when their dog stretched its forelegs at the entrance. If you had seen them, you would have fled away from them, filled with horror[12].","[12] Should anyone were to see them, he would see a group of awake men with a dog standing guarding them, and would surely be filled with horror, which was a factor in preserving them, so no one would dare to draw close to them."
2159,18,19,"Similarly, We awakened them so that they might question one another. One of them said, “How long have you been here?” They said, “We have been here for a day or part of a day.” They said, “Your Lord knows best how long have you been here. Send one of you with these silver coins of yours to the city, and let him see who has the most pure food and bring some provision from it. And be cautious and let no one know about you.",
2160,18,20,"For if they find out about you, they will stone you or force you back to their religion, and then you will never succeed.”",
2161,18,21,"This is how We made their case known so that the people might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour. When they were disputing among themselves[13] concerning their matter [of resurrection], they said, “Build a structure over them. Their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in their matter said, “We will surely build over them a place of worship.”","[13] i.e., the inhabitants of the city."
2162,18,22,"Some will say, “They were three, their dog was the fourth,” while others will say, “They were five, their dog was the sixth,” – merely guessing at the unseen. And others will say, “They were seven, their dog was the eighth.” Say, “My Lord knows best their number; no one knows about them except a few[14]. So do not argue about them except in a brief manner, nor ask anyone about them.”","[14] i.e., that which is the sure argument, one in the Qur’an."
2163,18,23,"And never say about anything, “I will surely do this tomorrow[15],”",[15] For you do not know whether you will be able to do it or you will be diverted from it.
2164,18,24,"without adding, “if Allah wills.” And remember your Lord if you forget, and say, “My Lord will hopefully guide me to something closer to what is right[16].”","[16] As soon as one remembers not saying inshā’ Allah concerning doing something in the future, he should say it. Also when one forgets something, he should mention Allah so as to remember things."
2165,18,25,"They remained in their cave for three hundred years, plus nine[17].","[17] i.e., 309 years."
2166,18,26,"Say, “Allah knows best how long they remained. To Him belongs [the knowledge of] the unseen of the heavens and earth. How well He sees and how well He hears[18]! They have no protector besides Him, and He shares His command with none.”","[18] i.e., Nothing can escape Allah’s Sight and Hearing."
2167,18,27,"Recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. None can change His Words, and you will never find any refuge except with Him[19].","[19] There is no escape from the punishment of Allah, should the Message not be conveyed, recited, and followed accordingly."
2168,18,28,"Be patient with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure. Do not turn your eyes away from them, desiring the adornments of the life of this world. And do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who follows his desires and whose affairs [deeds] are at loss.",
2169,18,29,"Say, “The truth is from your Lord. Whoever wills may believe, and whoever wills may disbelieve.” We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire which will encompass them like the walls. If they cry for relief, they will be relieved with water like boiling oil that will scald the faces. What a terrible drink, and what a terrible resting place!",
2170,18,30,"Those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will not let the reward of those who do good deeds to go to waste.",
2171,18,31,"It is they who will have Gardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow. They will be adorned therein with golden bracelets and will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade, reclining on adorned couches. What an excellent reward, and what a pleasant resting place!",
2172,18,32,"Give them an example of two men[20]: to one of them We gave two gardens of grapevines and surrounded them with palm trees, and placed between them crops[21].","[20] i.e., one was a believer and the second a disbeliever; the disbeliever owned two gardens.
 [21] The arrogant and wealthy disbelievers of Makkah looked down upon the poor believers and demanded that the Prophet (ﷺ) expel them should he want them to sit and listen to him."
2173,18,33,"Each garden yielded its produce and did not fall short in the least, and We caused a stream to flow through them.",
2174,18,34,"And he had abundant fruit. He said to his companion, as he was conversing with him, “I am greater than you in wealth and superior in followers.”",
2175,18,35,"He entered his garden, having wronged himself[22], and said, “I do not think that this will ever perish,",[22] By being proud and disbeliever.
2176,18,36,"nor do I think that the Hour will ever come. Even if I am brought back to my Lord, I will surely find something better than this[23].”","[23] He thought should there be a tiny possibility of resurrection, based on his wrongful calculation that he was honored in this life because Allah loved him. Hence he fell into the fallacy that if he ever return to Him, he should only expect greater honoring, or he might have said that deridingly."
2177,18,37,"His companion said, while conversing with him, “Do you disbelieve in He Who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then fashioned you into a well-proportioned man[24]?",[24] The One Who created such a magnificent creation in the first place is able to recreate the creatures.
2178,18,38,"As for me: He is Allah, my Lord, and I do not associate anyone with my Lord.",
2179,18,39,"If only you had said, when you entered your garden, ‘This is by Allah’s Will; there is no power except with Allah.’ Even though you see me as inferior to you in wealth and children,",
2180,18,40,"it may well be that my Lord will give me something better than your garden, and send upon your garden a thunderbolt from the heaven, turning it into a barren land.",
2181,18,41,"Or its water may sink, so you will never be able to get it back.”",
2182,18,42,"Eventually, all his produce was destroyed and he started wringing his hands [in dismay] over what he had spent on it, as it had collapsed on its trellises, and he said, “Oh, would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord!”",
2183,18,43,"He had none to support him against Allah, nor could he support himself.",
2184,18,44,"In that situation[25], the authority only rests with Allah, the True God. He is best in reward and best in outcome.","[25] i.e., on the Day of Judgment."
2185,18,45,"Give them the example of the life of this world: it is like the plants of the earth, thriving when sustained by the rain We send down from the sky, but soon they turn into chaff scattered by the winds. Allah has full power over all things.",
2186,18,46,"Wealth and children are the adornments of the life of this world, but the lasting righteous deeds are better with your Lord in reward and better in hope.",
2187,18,47,"And [beware of] the Day when We will move the mountains away, and you will see the earth laid bare[26]; We will gather them all and not leave behind anyone of them.","[26] i.e., flattened."
2188,18,48,"They will be presented before your Lord in rows, “Now you have come to Us as We created you the first time[27], although you claimed that We would never appoint a time for your return.”","[27] Nude, uncircumcised, and lonely."
2189,18,49,"And the record [of deeds] will be placed before them, and you will see the wicked scared of what it contains. They will say, “Woe to us! What is this book that leaves nothing, small or big, except that it has recorded it?” They will find all what they did before them, and your Lord does not wrong anyone.",
2190,18,50,"And [remember] when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all prostrated except Iblīs, who was one of the jinn, but he disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you then take him and his progeny as protectors instead of Me[28], even though they are your enemies[29]? What a terrible exchange for the wrongdoers!","[28] Demons could possess their idols and communicate through them; they also used to seek refuge from the evil of the jinn by appraising them and slaughtering sacrifices for them.
 [29] Satan along with his fellow demons continues to lead people astray from the right Path."
2191,18,51,"I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and earth, nor even the creation of their own selves, and I would not take those who misguide others as helpers[30].","[30] Allah, the source of guidance, would not take false deities who are the main cause of misguidance as helpers."
2192,18,52,"And [beware of] the Day when He will say, “Call upon those whom you claimed to be My partners.” So they will call them, but they will not respond to them[31], and We will make them share the same doom.",[31] The false deities they took besides Allah will let them down when they need them most on Judgment Day.
2193,18,53,"The wicked will see the Fire and realize that they are bound to fall into it, and they will find no escape from it.",
2194,18,54,"We have surely diversified in this Qur’an every kind of example for people[32], but man is the most quarrelsome of all beings[33].","[32] So that people may become mindful and be guided.
 [33] Humans always defend their position instead of yielding to the truth. It pertains to disbelievers more than anyone else."
2195,18,55,"Nothing prevents people from believing when guidance comes to them and from seeking forgiveness from their Lord except that the fate of the earlier nations should come to them, or that the punishment should come before their eyes.",
2196,18,56,"We do not send the messengers except as bearers of glad tidings and warners. But those who disbelieve seek to undermine the truth with false arguments, and they take My verses and warnings in ridicule.",
2197,18,57,"Who could be more wrong than one who is reminded of the verses of his Lord, but he turns away from them and forgets what his hands have sent forth? We have placed veils on their hearts so that they cannot understand it, and deafness in their ears. Even if you call them to guidance, they will never be guided.",
2198,18,58,"But your Lord is the All-Forgiving, Lord of Mercy. If He were to take them to task for what they did, He would have hastened their punishment. Yet there is an appointed time for them from which they will find no escape.",
2199,18,59,"Those are the towns We destroyed when they persisted in wrongdoing, and We set an appointed time for their destruction.",
2200,18,60,"And [remember] when Moses said to his servant, “I will not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas, or I travel for ages.”",
2201,18,61,"But when they reached the junction of the two seas, they forgot their fish, which made its way into the sea, slipping away.",
2202,18,62,"When they traveled further, he said to his servant, “Bring us our morning meal; this journey has truly exhausted us.”",
2203,18,63,"He said, “You remember when we rested by the rock, I forgot the fish; it was none who made me forget to mention it except Satan, and it made its way into the sea amazingly.”",
2204,18,64,"Moses said, “That is exactly what we were looking for.” So they turned back, retracing their footsteps.",
2205,18,65,There they found one of Our slaves[34] upon whom We bestowed Our mercy[35] and We taught him from Our Own knowledge[36].,"[34] i.e., Al-Khidr.
 [35] i.e., Prophethood or being a righteous servant of Allah.
 [36] i.e., the knowledge that Allah gave him such as knowledge of some unseen events, of which others were unaware."
2206,18,66,"Moses said to him, “May I follow you so that you may teach me some knowledge that you have been taught?”",
2207,18,67,"He said, “You will never be able to have patience with me.”",
2208,18,68,How can you have patience with that which you have no knowledge about?”,
2209,18,69,"Moses said, “You will find me patient, if Allah wills; and I will not disobey any of your orders.”",
2210,18,70,"He said, “Then if you follow me, do not ask me about anything until I mention it to you.”",
2211,18,71,"So they both set out, until when they boarded a ship, he made a hole in it. Moses said, “Did you make a hole in it to drown its people? You have done something terrible!”",
2212,18,72,"He said, “Did I not tell you that you will never be able to have patience with me?”",
2213,18,73,"Moses said, “Do not take me to task for what I forgot, and do not make it too difficult for me to follow you.”",
2214,18,74,"Then they proceeded until they met a boy, and the man killed him. Moses said, “Did you kill an innocent soul who killed none? You have done something monstrous!”",
2215,18,75,"The man said, “Did I not tell you that you will never be able to have patience with me?”",
2216,18,76,"Moses said, “If I ask you about anything after this, do not keep me in your company, for then you would be excused concerning me.”",
2217,18,77,"Then they went on until they came to the people of a town[37]. They asked its people for food, but they refused to offer them hospitality. They found there a wall that was about to collapse, but he repaired it. Moses said, “If you wished, you could have taken some payment for it.”",[37] Who were extremely mean folk.

2221,18,81,"So we hoped that their Lord would give them another in his place, more righteous and tender-hearted.",
2222,18,82,"As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was a treasure under it that belonged to them. Their father was a righteous man, so your Lord willed that they should reach their maturity and retrieve their treasure[39], as a mercy from your Lord; I did not do it of my own accord. This is the interpretation of that which you could not bear with patience.”","[39] Had they not mended the wall, it would have subsequently fallen; they, being young, weak, and surrounded by mean people, would certainly have lost their treasure."

Say, “I will tell you something about him.”","[40] The Two-Horned Sovereign, about whom the Quraysh pagans asked the Prophet (ﷺ), along with that of the Companions of the Cave, testing his prophethood. He was named thus because he reached the rising point and the setting point of the sun; or two generations (qarns) of people passed away during his reign; or he had two long locks of hair; or his crown had two horns."
2224,18,84,We established him on earth and gave him the means to achieve everything[41].,"[41] Such as soldiers, weaponry, etc."

2226,18,86,"until when he reached the far west, he found the sun setting in a dark body of water, and he found some people nearby. We said, “O Dhul-Qarnayn, either punish them or treat them with kindness.”",
2227,18,87,"He said, “As for one who does wrong[43], we will punish him, then he will be brought back to his Lord, and He will punish him grievously.",[43] By persisting in disbelief and associating partners with Allah.

2231,18,91,"So it was, and We had full knowledge about him[46].","[46] i.e., Dhul-Qarnayn."
2232,18,92,"Then he pursued another course,",
2233,18,93,"until when he reached [a valley] between the two mountains, he found beyond them a people who could barely understand a word[47].",[47] They could not speak except their own language.

2261,19,11,Thereupon he came out to his people from the sanctuary and signaled to them to glorify Allah morning and evening.,
2262,19,12,"[Allah said], “O John, hold the Scripture with all your strength.” And We gave him wisdom when he was still a child,",

2296,19,46,"He said, “Are you turning away from my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I will surely stone you. Keep away from me for a long time!”",

2299,19,49,"When he distanced himself from them and what they worshiped besides Allah, We granted him Isaac and Jacob and made each one of them a prophet.",

2301,19,51,And mention in the Book [the story of] Moses. He was indeed a chosen one and was a messenger and a prophet[13].,"[13] A messenger (rasūl) is one who was sent by Allah to reform society with a new law, such as Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, etc. A prophet (nabī) is one who is charged by Allah to reform society following the law of the messenger before him, such as Jacob, Isaac, Solomon, etc. Prophets are more numerous than messengers."
2302,19,52,We called him from the right side of Mount Tūr [in Sinai] and We brought him near by conversing with him in private.,
2303,19,53,"And We granted him, by Our mercy, his brother Aaron, as a prophet.",

2306,19,56,And mention in the Book [the story of] Idrīs[14]. He was a man of truth and a prophet.,"[14] i.e., Prophet Enoch (عليه السلام)."
2307,19,57,And We raised him to a high status[15].,[15] Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) met Prophet Idrīs (ﷺ) in the fourth heaven.

Whenever the verses of the Most Compassionate were recited to them, they fell down in prostration, weeping.",
2309,19,59,"But they were succeeded by generations who neglected prayer and pursued their desires; so they will meet their doom[16],","[16] i.e., a valley in Hell or the consequence of their evil deeds."

2319,19,69,Then We will surely drag out of every group those who were most rebellious against the Most Compassionate.,
2320,19,70,For indeed We know best those who are most deserving to burn therein.,
2321,19,71,There is none among you except that he will pass over it[20]; a decree from your Lord that must be fulfilled.,"[20] Referring to the bridge of As-Sirāt, which is placed over Hell. Everyone will pass on it. The believers will cross it easily, each according to their faith, whereas the disbelievers and the hypocrites will fall into the Fire from the bridge."

 [11] The Coptic person died after Moses struck him."
2389,20,41,I have chosen you for Myself.,
2390,20,42,"Go forth, you and your brother, with My signs, and do not slacken in remembering Me.",
2391,20,43,"Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has certainly transgressed all bounds.",
2392,20,44,"But speak to him gently, so that he may take heed or fear Allah.”",
2393,20,45,"They said, “Our Lord, we fear that he may hasten to punish us or transgress all bounds.”",
2394,20,46,"He said, “Do not be afraid; I am with you both, hearing and seeing.",
2395,20,47,"So go to him and say, ‘We are both messengers from your Lord, so let the Children of Israel go with us and do not oppress them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord, and peace[12] be upon he who follows the true guidance.","[12] i.e., safety from the punishment of Allah."
2396,20,48,It has been revealed to us that the punishment awaits those who reject [the truth] and turn away.’”,
2397,20,49,"Pharaoh said, “So who is the Lord of you two, O Moses?”",
2398,20,50,"He said, “Our Lord is the One Who gave everything its form and then guided it.”",
2399,20,51,"Pharaoh said, “Then what about the former [disbelieving] nations?”",
2400,20,52,"He said, “Its knowledge is with my Lord in a Record. My Lord never errs, nor does He forget.”",
2401,20,53,"It is He Who spread out the earth for you and made therein pathways for you, and sent down rain from the sky; and We brought forth thereby various types of plants.",
2402,20,54,"Eat and graze your livestock. Indeed, there are signs in this for people of sound intellect.",
2403,20,55,"From this [earth] We created you, and to it We will return you, and from it We will raise you once again.",
2404,20,56,"We showed Pharaoh all Our signs, but he rejected them and refused to believe.",
2405,20,57,"He said, “Have you come to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Moses?",
2406,20,58,"We will surely bring you similar magic. So appoint a day between us that neither you nor we will fail to keep, in a convenient place[13].”","[13] i.e., a midway place between us."
2407,20,59,"Moses said, “Your appointment is the festival day[14]; let the people be gathered at forenoon[15].”","[14] So that more people could witness the event.
 [15] So that people could see Allah’s signs clearly."
2408,20,60,"So Pharaoh went away and put together his scheme, then came forth.",
2409,20,61,"Moses said to them, “Woe to you, do not fabricate lies against Allah[16], lest He exterminate you with a punishment. Those who fabricate lies are bound to fail.”",[16] By considering Allah’s miracles as magic.
2410,20,62,Then they disputed the matter among themselves and kept their talk private.,
2411,20,63,"They said, “These two are merely magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and destroy your exemplary way of life.",
2412,20,64,"So gather your scheme, then line up in a row. Whoever prevails today is indeed the victor.”",
2413,20,65,"They said, “O Moses, either you throw or shall we be the first to throw!”",
2414,20,66,"He said, “No; you throw first.” Suddenly their ropes and staffs appeared to him, owing to their magic, as if they were slithering.",
2415,20,67,Then Moses sensed fear within himself.,
2416,20,68,"We said, “Do not be afraid; it is you who will prevail.",
2417,20,69,"Throw what is in your right hand; it will swallow up what they have contrived. They have only contrived a magic trick, and the magician will never prosper, wherever he goes.”",
2418,20,70,"So the magicians fell down in prostration[17], saying, “We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.”","[17] They realized that the miracles of Moses were not impressions of magic, but absolute realities."
2419,20,71,"Pharaoh said, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission! He must be your master who taught you magic! I will surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees; you will surely know whose punishment is more severe and more lasting!”",
2420,20,72,"They said, “We will never prefer you over the clear signs that have come to us, or over the One Who created us[18]. So decide whatever you will. You can only make a decision about the life of this world.","[18] It can also be interpreted as an oath, i.e., “By the One Who created us, we will never prefer you over...”."
2421,20,73,"We surely believe in our Lord so that He may forgive us our sins and the magic that you have compelled us to practice, for Allah is best [in reward] and more lasting [in punishment].”",
2422,20,74,"Whoever comes to his Lord as an evildoer, for him is Hell; he will neither die therein nor live[19].","[19] He will neither die to relax from punishment, nor live a pleasant life."
2423,20,75,"But whoever comes to Him as a believer, having done righteous deeds, it is they who will have the highest ranks:",
2424,20,76,"Gardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Such is the reward of those who purify themselves[20].",[20] From disbelief and sins.
2425,20,77,"We inspired Moses, “Travel by night with My slaves, and strike for them a dry path across the sea. Have no fear of being overtaken, nor be afraid [of drowning].”",
2426,20,78,"Then Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, but they were completely overwhelmed by the sea[21].","[21] i.e., not only drowning in water but other things which are only known to Allah such as terror, pain, regret, etc."
2427,20,79,Thus Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide them.,
2428,20,80,"O Children of Israel, We rescued you from your enemy, and made an appointment with you[22] on the right side of Mount Tūr [in Sinai], and sent down for you manna and quails[23],","[22] i.e., with your prophet to talk to him and receive the Tablets for your guidance.
 [23] They were provided with manna (bread or honey-like food) and quails in the wilderness after they left Egypt."
2429,20,81,"[saying], “Eat from the good things We have provided for you, but do not exceed the limits therein, or My wrath will befall you, for anyone upon whom My wrath befalls is perished.",
2430,20,82,"I am indeed Most Forgiving to those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds, then stay on the right path.”",
2431,20,83,"[Allah asked], “What made you hasten from your people, O Moses?”[24]","[24] Moses chose a delegation of seventy people from the Children of Israel to go to Mount Tūr to receive the Tablets. He was in haste to meet his Lord, so he rushed to the appointment and arrived before his people, leaving them behind. See (7:143-145)"
2432,20,84,"He said, “They are following my footsteps; I hastened to You, my Lord, to please You.”",
2433,20,85,"Allah said, “We have certainly tested your people in your absence, and Sāmiri[25] has led them astray.”","[25] i.e., the Samaritan (a man from Samaria), a hypocrite who led the Children of Israel to the worship of the calf, or to idol-worship."
2434,20,86,"So Moses returned to his people, angry and sorrowful. He said, “O my people, did your Lord not promise you a good promise[26]? Was my absence too long for you, or did you want the wrath from your Lord to befall you, so you broke your promise to me[27]?”",[26] To send down the Torah for your guidance. [27] Of worshiping Allah alone until Moses comes back to them.
2435,20,87,"They said, “We did not break our promise to you out of our own free will, but we were made to carry loads of the people’s jewelry, so we threw them [into the fire], and so did the Sāmiri throw.”[28]","[28] They carried loads of jewelry of the people of the Pharaoh that they had with them, so they threw them into the fire in order to get rid of them. As for the Sāmiri, he threw the dust that he collected from the hoof-print of Gabriel’s horse."
2436,20,88,"Then he molded for them an image of a calf that made a mooing sound. They said, “This is your god and Moses’ god, but he has forgotten.”",
2437,20,89,"Do they not see that it does not respond a word to them, nor does it have the power to harm or benefit them?",
2438,20,90,"Aaron told them beforehand, “O my people, you are being tested with it. Your Lord is the Most Compassionate, so follow me and obey my command.”",
2439,20,91,"They said, “We will never cease to worship it until Moses comes back to us.”",
2440,20,92,"Moses said, “O Aaron, what prevented you when you saw them going astray,",
2441,20,93,from following me? Did you disobey my command?”[29],[29] See 7:142.
2442,20,94,"Aaron said, “O son of my mother, do not seize me by my beard or by my head! I feared that you would say, ‘You have caused division among the Children of Israel, and did not heed my words.’”",
2443,20,95,"Moses said, “What is the matter with you, O Sāmiri?”",
2444,20,96,"He said, “I saw something they did not see, so I took a handful [of dust] from the hoof-print of the horse of the messenger [Gabriel] and cast it [into the fire][30]. This is what my mind prompted me.”","[30] While Moses and the Children of Israel were crossing the sea, the Sāmiri saw Gabriel on a horse leading the way, so he took a handful of dust from the hoof-prints of his horse and later threw it at the calf that was made out of the melted ornaments so it started making a bellowing sound."
2445,20,97,"Moses said, “Begone then! Your [punishment] in this life will be to say, ‘Do not touch me,’[31] but there awaits you an appointed time for your reckoning that you cannot escape[32]. Now look at your so-called god which you kept worshiping; We will surely burn it and then scatter it in the sea.","[31] So he was completely shunned by all people, alienated in the desert.
 [32] On the Day of Judgment."
2446,20,98,"[O people], your god is only Allah; none has the right to be worshiped except Him. He encompasses everything in knowledge.”",
2447,20,99,"This is how We relate to you [O Prophet] from the stories of the past, and We have given you a Reminder[33] from Us.","[33] i.e., the Qur’an."
2448,20,100,"Whoever turns away from it will bear a heavy burden on the Day of Resurrection,",
2449,20,101,abiding therein forever[34]. What a terrible burden they will carry on the Day of Resurrection!,"[34] i.e., in the state of sin and punishment."
2450,20,102,the Day when the Trumpet will be blown; on that Day We will gather together the wicked sightless[35] [from horror].,"[35] i.e., blind, blue-eyed, blue-faced out of terror."
2451,20,103,"They will whisper to one another, “You stayed no more than ten days [on earth].”",
2452,20,104,"We know best what they will say – the most discerning among them will say, “You stayed no more than a day.”",
2453,20,105,"They ask you about the mountains, say, “My Lord will scatter them into dust,",
2454,20,106,"and He will leave the earth level and plain,",
2455,20,107,you will not see therein any troughs or peaks.”,
2456,20,108,"On that day, they will follow the summoner[36]; none will dare to deviate. All voices will be hushed in awe before the Most Compassionate; you will hear nothing except a whisper[37].",[36] To the gathering for reckoning. [37] Or the sound of footsteps.
2457,20,109,"On that day, no intercession will be of any use except to whom the Most Compassionate gave permission and approved his word.",
2458,20,110,"He knows all that is ahead of them and all that is behind them[38], but they do not encompass it[39] with their knowledge.","[38] i.e., what awaits them in the Hereafter and what they did in the world.
 [39] i.e., His knowledge."
2459,20,111,"All faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, Self-Sustaining. Those burdened with wrongdoing[40] will be in a total loss.","[40] i.e., sins, evil deeds, or wrongdoing towards others."
2460,20,112,"But whoever does righteous deeds, being a believer, will have no fear of being wronged or deprived.",
2461,20,113,"We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an and diversified its warnings, so that they may fear Allah or it may cause them to take heed.",
2462,20,114,"So Exalted is Allah, the True Sovereign[41]. Do not hasten to [recite] the Qur’an before its revelation to you is concluded[42], and say, “My Lord, increase me in knowledge.”","[41] Of everything in existence.
 [42] Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) was eager to recite the Qur’an while it was being revealed, so Allah Almighty told him to avoid being in haste in order to learn them before the verses are properly delivered; rather, listen to them attentively."
2463,20,115,"We had already given a command to Adam before, but he forgot, and We found him lacking a firm resolve[43].",[43] To resist the temptation of eating from the forbidden tree.
2464,20,116,"When We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” they all prostrated, except Iblīs[44], who refused.",[44] See footnote 2:34.

2468,20,120,"Then Satan whispered to him, and said, “O Adam, shall I show you the tree of immortality and a kingdom that will never decay?”",
2469,20,121,"So they both ate from the tree, then their nakedness was revealed to each other, and they began to put together leaves from Paradise to cover themselves. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord and fell into error[45].","[45] Unlike the Bible, the Qur’an does not put the blame on Eve for Adam’s sin, for which they were ousted from the Garden and sent down to the earth. See: (Genesis 3)."
2470,20,122,"Thereafter his Lord chose him, accepted his repentance, and guided him.",
2471,20,123,"Allah said, “Get down, both of you, from here altogether [with Satan] as enemies to one another. Then when there comes to you guidance from Me, whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray nor fall into misery[46].",[46] Neither go astray (in this life) nor fall into misery (in the Hereafter).

2475,20,127,This is how We recompense those who transgress the limits and do not believe in the verses of his Lord; and the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more lasting[48].,[48] Than that of the worldly life.

2545,21,62,"They said, “Are you the one who did this to our gods, O Abraham?”",
2546,21,63,"He said, “Rather, it was this biggest one who did it. So ask them, if they can speak!”",
2547,21,64,"So they turned back to one another, and said, “Indeed, it is you who are the wrongdoers.”",
2548,21,65,"Then they turned to their obstinacy[24], [saying], “You already know that they cannot speak.”",[24] After first admitting their error.

2562,21,79,"We made Solomon understand it[32], although We gave each of them sound judgment and knowledge. We subjected the mountains and birds to glorify Allah along with David. It was We Who did all this.","[32] A man’s flock of sheep strayed into another man’s tillage. When the two men came to David for judgment, he ruled that the shepherd must give his sheep in compensation for the damage. Nonetheless, Solomon suggested that the sheep be kept with the owner of the tillage, so he may benefit from their milk and wool, while the shepherd should work on the land to restore it to its former state. Thus, the farmer would take back his tillage in perfect condition, and the sheep would be returned to its owner. David was impressed by his son’s insightful and fair judgment and approved it."
2563,21,80,And We taught him[33] the art of making coats of mail for you to protect yourselves in your battle. Will you then be grateful?,"[33] i.e., David apart from Solomon."
2564,21,81,"And to Solomon [We subjected] the raging wind, to blow by his command to the land We had blessed. It is We Who have full knowledge of everything.",

We settle in the wombs whatever We will for an appointed term. Then We bring you out as infants, then [We nurture you] so that you may reach your maturity.

2685,23,12,"We created man[4] from an extract of clay,","[4] i.e., Adam (عليه السلام)."
2686,23,13,"then We placed him as a sperm-drop[5] in a safe place,","[5] i.e., a zygote."
2687,23,14,"then We made the sperm drop into a clinging clot, then We made the clinging clot into a lump, then We made the lump into bones, and We clothed the bones with flesh, and then We developed it into another creation[6]. So Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators.",[6] After breathing the spirit into the embryo.

 [15] i.e., those who refuse to believe in the messengers."
2718,23,45,Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs[16] and compelling proof[17],"[16] Allah sent them both with nine clear signs or miracles: the staff turning into a snake, the bright hand, famine, shortage of crops, floods, locusts, lice, frogs, and blood.

2719,23,46,"to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they showed arrogance and were haughty people.",
2720,23,47,"They said, “Should we believe in two men like ourselves when their people are our slaves?”",
2721,23,48,So they rejected them both and were among those who were destroyed.,
2722,23,49,We gave Moses the Scripture so that they[18] might be guided.,"[18] i.e., the Children of Israel."
2723,23,50,We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign[19] and sheltered them on a hillside – a place of rest and a flowing stream[20].,"[19] The miraculous birth of Jesus is clear proof of Allah's Omnipotence that Mary gave birth to him without male interference.
 [20] Other Prophets were rejected for being human beings; whereas, people went to two extremes regarding Jesus: some considered him as divine, while some others went to the other extreme by accusing Mary of unchastity, although they were witnesses of the miraculous birth of Jesus and had heard him speak in the cradle."
2724,23,51,"O messengers[21], eat from the lawful things[22] and act righteously, for I am All-Knowing of what you do.","[21] In this verse, all of the messengers have been addressed together, which indicates that they all belonged to the same community and their message was one.

2726,23,53,"But people split up their religion into factions, each faction rejoicing in what it has[24].","[24] Of beliefs, opinions, and customs."

We have a Record [of their deeds][28] that tells the truth, and none will be wronged[29].",[28] It records every word he utters and every act he does.

 [33] This was another proof of the Prophet’s prophethood, for he was conveying the message without demanding any recompense for it; rather, he staked his peaceful life and relationships with his people for accomplishing his mission."
2746,23,73,"Indeed, you are calling them to a straight path,",
2747,23,74,but those who do not believe in the Hereafter are deviating from that path.,
2748,23,75,"Even if We were to show them mercy and relieve their adversity[34], they would still persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.",[34] It refers to the famine which occurred in Makkah some time after the advent of prophethood.
2749,23,76,"We have already seized them with punishment, but they did not humble themselves to their Lord, nor did they supplicate in humility,",

Otherwise, each god would have taken away what he had created, and each would have tried to gain supremacy over the other[40]. Glory be to Allah far above what they ascribe to Him!",[40] Then there would have been serious conflicts and wars among different sovereigns and gods.

2768,23,95,We are surely able to show you that of which We have warned them.,
2769,23,96,Repel evil with what is best; We know well what they claim[43].,"[43] That there are other gods besides Allah, and that the Prophet is a liar, a poet, etc."

Do not let pity for them make you lenient concerning the law of Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment[1].",[1] Fornication has to be proven either by confession or the testimony of four reliable witnesses to having actually seen the act take place. This ruling is applicable to unmarried fornicators. Execution by stoning is confirmed in the sunnah for married adulterers.

3205,27,46,"He said, “O my people, why do you seek to hasten punishment rather than good?[15] If only you sought Allah’s forgiveness, so that you may be shown mercy!”",[15] They challenged Sālih to bring them the punishment rather than asking for mercy from Allah.
3206,27,47,"They said, “We consider you and those who are with you as a bad omen.” He said, “Your omen is from Allah, but you are a people who are being tested.”",
3207,27,48,There were nine men in the city who used to spread corruption in the land without doing anything good.,
3208,27,49,"They said, “Let us all swear by Allah that we will kill him and his family by night. Then we will tell his heir[16], ‘We did not witness the murder of his family, and we are indeed truthful.’”","[16] i.e., the one who executes his will and avenges his blood."
3209,27,50,"Thus they made a plan and We too made a plan, but they were unaware of it.",
3210,27,51,See then what was the consequences of their plan: We destroyed them and their entire people.,
3211,27,52,"Now their houses are utterly ruined because of their wrongdoing. Indeed, there are signs in this for people of knowledge.",
3212,27,53,And We saved those who believed and feared Allah.,
3213,27,54,"And [remember] Lot, when he said to his people, “Do you commit this shameful act[17] while seeing [one another][18]?","[17] i.e., sodomy.
 [18] i.e., publicly, or while you are aware [that it is wrong]."
3214,27,55,"Do you approach men with lust instead of women? In fact, you are an ignorant people!”",
3215,27,56,"But the only response his people gave was to say, “Drive the family of Lot out of your town, for they are a people who keep themselves pure!”",
3216,27,57,"So We saved him and his family, except his wife whom We destined to be among those who would remain behind.",
3217,27,58,And We rained upon them a rain [of stones]. How terrible was the rain of those who were warned!,
3218,27,59,"Say, [O Prophet], “All praise is for Allah, and peace be upon His slaves whom He has chosen. Is Allah better, or those partners whom they associate with Him?”",
3219,27,60,"Is He [not better] Who created the heavens and earth, and sent down for you rain from the sky, by which We caused to grow gardens of cheerful beauty? You could never cause their trees to grow. Is there any god besides Allah? No, but they are people who ascribe equals [to Allah].",
3220,27,61,"Is He [not better] Who made the earth a stable place to live, and caused rivers to flow through it, and placed therein firm mountains, and made a barrier between two flowing bodies of water[19]? Is there any god besides Allah? No, but most of them do not know.",[19] See footnote 25:53.
3221,27,62,"Is He [not better] Who responds to the distressed when he calls out to Him, and Who relieves suffering, and Who makes you successors[20] on earth? Is there any god besides Allah? Little is it that you take heed!",[20] One generation after another generation.
3222,27,63,"Is He [not better] Who guides you in the depths of the darkness of the land and sea[21], and Who sends the winds as harbingers ahead of His mercy[22]? Is there any god besides Allah? Exalted is Allah far above the partners they associate with Him!","[21] Through the stars, constellations, and landmarks. [22] i.e., the rain."
3223,27,64,"Is He [not better] Who originates creation then repeats it, and Who gives you provision from the heaven and earth? Is there any god besides Allah? Say, “Produce your evidence, if you are truthful.”",
3224,27,65,"Say, “No one in the heavens and earth has knowledge of the unseen except Allah.” Nor do they know when they will be resurrected.",
3225,27,66,"In fact, their knowledge cannot comprehend the Hereafter; rather, they are in doubt about it; rather, they are blind to it.",
3226,27,67,"Those who disbelieve say, “What! Is it that when we and our forefathers become dust, will we really be brought forth [alive]?",
3227,27,68,We and our forefathers have been promised this before; this is nothing but ancient fables!”,
3228,27,69,"Say, “Travel in the land and see how was the end of the wicked.”",
3229,27,70,"Do not grieve over them, nor be distressed by their plots.",
3230,27,71,"They say, “When will this warning come to pass, if you are truthful?”",
3231,27,72,"Say, “Perhaps some of what you seek to hasten is quite near to you.”",
3232,27,73,"Indeed, your Lord is graceful to mankind[23], but most of them are ungrateful.",[23] As He delays their punishment and grants them respite to repent.
3233,27,74,Your Lord surely knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal[24].,[24] In words or actions.
3234,27,75,For there is nothing hidden in the heavens and earth except that it is [written] in a clear Record[25].,"[25] i.e., the Preserved Tablet (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfūz)."
3235,27,76,"Indeed, this Qur’an explains to the Children of Israel most of that over which they differ.",
3236,27,77,And it is certainly a guidance and mercy for the believers.,
3237,27,78,"Indeed, your Lord will judge between them by His justice, for He is the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.",
3238,27,79,"So put your trust in Allah, for you are upon the clear truth.",
3239,27,80,"You cannot make the dead[26] hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs retreating.","[26] i.e., whose hearts have died due to their disbelief in Allah."
3240,27,81,"Nor can you guide the blind out of their error, nor can you make anyone hear except those who believe in Our verses, for they are ready to submit to Allah.",
3241,27,82,"When the decree [of the Hour] comes to pass against them, We will bring forth to them a beast[27] out of the earth that will tell them that the people had no faith in Our verses.",[27] The emergence of this beast is one of the major signs of the Day of Judgment; it will speak to people.
3242,27,83,"And [beware of] the Day when We will gather from every nation a group of those who used to reject Our verses, and they will be driven in ranks.",
3243,27,84,"When they finally come, He will say, “Did you reject My verses without even comprehending them, or what exactly were you doing?",
3244,27,85,"The decree [of punishment] will befall them because of their wrongdoing, leaving them speechless.",
3245,27,86,"Do they not see that We made the night for them to rest in, and made the day bright? Indeed, there are signs in this for people who believe.",
3246,27,87,"And [beware of] the Day when the Trumpet will be blown, and all those who are in the heavens and on earth will be horrified except whom Allah wills[28], and all will come to Him, fully humbled.","[28] The Trumpet will be blown twice: The first blow will cause all to be horrified and then they will die, except whom Allah spares, and the second blow will cause all to be resurrected."
3247,27,88,"You will see the mountains, thinking them firmly fixed[29], but they will be moving like clouds – such is the design of Allah, Who has perfected everything. Indeed, He is All-Aware of what you do.",[29] Or solid.
3248,27,89,"Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded with better than it, and they will be safe from the horror of that Day.",
3249,27,90,But whoever comes with an evil deed[30] will be thrown on their faces in the Fire. Are you recompensed except for what you used to do?,[30] Without having repented from disbelief or sins.
3250,27,91,"Say, “I have been commanded only to worship the Lord of this city [of Makkah] Who made it sacred and to Whom belongs all things. And I am commanded to be one of those who submit to Allah [in Islam],",
3251,27,92,"and to recite the Qur’an.” Then whoever chooses guidance, it is only for his own good; but whoever chooses to go astray, say [O Prophet], “I am only one of the warners.”",
3252,27,93,"And say, “All praise is for Allah. He will show you His signs, then you will acknowledge them. Your Lord is not unaware of what you do.”",
3253,28,1,Tā Sīn Mīm.[1],[1] See footnote 2:1.
3254,28,2,These are the verses of the clear Book.,
3255,28,3,We recount to you part of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in truth for people who believe.,
3256,28,4,"Indeed, Pharaoh arrogantly elevated himself in the land and divided its people into different factions; oppressing one group of them[2], slaughtering their sons and sparing their women alive[3]. He was truly one of those who spread corruption.","[2] i.e., the Children of Israel.
 [3] For their own service and as a sign of humiliation to the Children of Israel."
3257,28,5,"But We wanted to bestow favor upon those who were oppressed in the land[4], and make them leaders and inheritors [of the land],","[4] i.e., the Children of Israel who were oppressed by Pharaoh in Egypt."
3258,28,6,"and to establish them in the land, and to show Pharaoh, Hāmān[5] and their soldiers[6] that which they feared[7].","[5] Hāmān was Pharaoh’s minister during the time of Moses.
 [6] Through those whom they oppressed and enslaved.
 [7] i.e., the fulfillment of the Pharaoh’s old dream that his kingdom would come to an end at the hands of a newborn from the Children of Israel."
3259,28,7,"We inspired the mother of Moses, “Suckle him; but when you fear for him, cast him into the river, and do not fear or grieve. We will surely return him to you, and will make him one of the messengers.”",
3260,28,8,"Then the household of Pharaoh picked him up, so that he may become an enemy to them and a source of grief. Indeed, Pharaoh, Hāmān and their soldiers were wrongdoers.",
3261,28,9,"Pharaoh’s wife said, “He is a source of joy for me and you. Do not kill him; he will probably benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son.” They were unaware [of the consequences].",
3262,28,10,"The heart of Moses’ mother became restless; she was about to disclose it, had We not reassured her heart so that she would maintain her faith [in Allah’s promise].",
3263,28,11,"She said to his sister, “Keep track of him.” So she watched him from a distance, without them noticing.",
3264,28,12,"We had already forbidden for him all wet nurses[8], then she said, “Shall I direct you to a household who will nurse him for you and take good care of him?”",[8] Moses had refused to nurse from any other woman.
3265,28,13,"Then We returned him to his mother so that she would be comforted and not grieve, and so that she would know that Allah’s promise is true. Yet most of them do not know.",
3266,28,14,"When he reached his full strength and maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. This is how We reward those who do good.",
3267,28,15,"Once he entered the city unnoticed by its people[9], and found two men fighting: one of his own people and the other of his enemies. The one from his own people called him for help against his enemy, so Moses struck him with his fist, causing his death. Moses said, “This is of Satan’s work; he is a sworn enemy who mislead people.”","[9] i.e., as it was the time of rest at noon."
3268,28,16,"He said, “My Lord, I have wronged myself, so forgive me,” Then He forgave him, for He is indeed the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.",
3269,28,17,"He said, “My Lord, because of the blessings that You have bestowed upon me, I will never be a supporter of the wicked.”",
3270,28,18,"Then he became fearful and vigilant in the city; suddenly the one who sought his help the day before cried out to him again for help. Moses said to him, “You are clearly a troublemaker.”",
3271,28,19,"When he was about to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them, he[10] said, “O Moses, do you want to kill me as you killed that person yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land, and you do not want to be one of those who put things right!”","[10] i.e., the Israelite thought that Moses wanted to strike him."
3272,28,20,"Then there came a man rushing from the farthest end of the city, and said, “O Moses, the chiefs are conspiring to kill you, so leave. I am giving you sincere advice.”",
3273,28,21,"So he left the city, fearful and vigilant. He said, “My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people.”",
3274,28,22,"When he headed towards Midian, he said, “My Lord will surely guide me to a straight way.”",
3275,28,23,"When he arrived at the well of Midian, he found a crowd of people watering [their flocks] and found apart from them two women holding [their flocks] back. He said, “What is the matter with you?” They said, “We cannot water [them] until the shepherds take [their flocks] away, and our father is a very old man.”",
3276,28,24,"So he watered [their flocks] for them, then he turned to the shade and said, “My Lord, I am desperately in need of whatever good You may send down to me[11].”","[11] Moses left Egypt having nothing until he arrived in Midian. As soon as he sought Allah's help, Allah gave him a wife, a livelihood, and a home."
3277,28,25,"Then one of the two women came to him, walking modestly. She said, “My father[12] is inviting you so that he may reward you for watering [our flocks] for us.” When he came to him and told him the whole story, he said, “Have no fear. You are now safe from the wrongdoing people.”","[12] Prophet Shu‘ayb, the father of the two women."
3278,28,26,"One of the two daughters said, “O dear father, hire him; the best one you can hire is the strong and trustworthy.”",
3279,28,27,"He said, “I would like to give you one of these two daughters of mine in marriage, provided that you serve me for eight years; if you complete ten, it will be of your own free will. I do not want to make things difficult for you. You will find me, if Allah wills, from among the righteous.”",
3280,28,28,"Moses said, “Let that be the agreement between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I complete, there will be no further obligation on me, and Allah is Witness over what we say.”",
3281,28,29,"When Moses had completed the term[13] and was traveling with his family, he spotted a fire in the direction of Mount Tūr. He said to his family[14], “Stay here; I have spotted a fire. Perhaps I will bring you from there some news or a brand of fire so that you may warm yourselves.”","[13] Moses completed the ten years term instead of eight years.
 [14] From Midian to Egypt."
3282,28,30,"But when he came to it, he was called from the tree[15] in the sacred ground on the right side of the valley: “O Moses, I am Allah, the Lord of the worlds.",[15] Which was within the fire.
3283,28,31,"Throw down your staff.” But when he saw it slithering as if it were a snake, he turned and ran away without looking back. [Allah said], “O Moses, come back, and have no fear; you are perfectly safe.",
3284,28,32,"Put your hand into your garment, it will come out shining white without blemish, and draw your arms tight to you to calm your fear. These are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs, for they are indeed a rebellious people.”",
3285,28,33,"Moses said, “My Lord, I have killed one of their men, and I fear that they may kill me.",
3286,28,34,"My brother Aaron is more eloquent than me in speech, so send him with me as a helper to confirm my words, for I fear that they may reject me.”",
3287,28,35,"Allah said, “We will strengthen you through your brother and give you both power, so they cannot harm you. With Our signs, you and your followers will prevail.”",
3288,28,36,"When Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said, “This is nothing but fabricated magic; we have not heard of this from our earlier ancestors.”",
3289,28,37,"Moses said, “My Lord knows best who has come with guidance from Him and who will have the best abode in the end. The wrongdoers will never succeed.”",
3290,28,38,"Pharaoh said, “O chiefs, I do not know for you any god other than myself. So bake for me bricks out of clay, O Hāmān, and build for me a tower so that I may have a look at the God of Moses, for I think he is a liar.”",
3291,28,39,He and his soldiers were arrogant in the land without any right and thought that they would not be brought back to Us.,
3292,28,40,So We seized him and his soldiers and flung them into the sea[16]. See how was the end of the wrongdoers!,[16] Allah caused them to enter the sea in pursuit of Moses and the believers.
3293,28,41,"We made them leaders[17] calling to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped.","[17] i.e., precedents or role models, followed by subsequent tyrants."
3294,28,42,"We caused a curse to pursue them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among those who are despised.",
3295,28,43,"We gave Moses the Scripture after destroying earlier nations, as an insight for mankind, and a guidance and mercy, so that they may take heed.",
3296,28,44,"You were not [O Prophet] on the western side [of the mountain] when We gave Moses Our commandment, nor did you witness that event[18].","[18] The pagans of Makkah are recurrently reminded in the Quran that the Prophet (ﷺ) did not witness any of these events that happened centuries before his birth. See 12:102, 3:44, 11:49. So the only logical way of knowing about these stories is the divine revelation."
3297,28,45,"But We brought forth many generations [after Moses], and a long time passed on them[19]. And you [O Prophet] did not dwell among the people of Midian, rehearsing with them Our verses[20], but it is We Who sent you as a messenger [and revealed to you their stories].","[19] So they forgot and neglected the ordinances of Allah over time.
 [20] The Prophet (ﷺ) had no way of knowing these stories except through the revelation from Allah."
3298,28,46,"You were not at the side of Mount Tūr when We called out [to Moses]. But [you have been sent] as a mercy from your Lord, to warn a people to whom no warner had come before you, so that they may take heed.",
3299,28,47,"So they would not say – if struck by a calamity because of what their hands have sent forth, “Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, so we could follow Your verses and be among the believers?”",
3300,28,48,"But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “If only he was given the like of what was given to Moses before[21].” Did they not reject what was given to Moses before? They say, “Both [revelations] are works of magic, supporting each other”, adding, “We truly reject both of them[22].”","[21] The pagans of Makkah demanded that the Qur’an should have been revealed all at once like the Torah, and the Prophet (ﷺ) should have brought us tangible miracles like Moses’ staff, illuminating hand, etc.
 [22] It refers to the pagans of Makkah concerning the Qur’an and the Torah."
3301,28,49,"Say, “Then bring a scripture from Allah which is better in guidance than these two so that I may follow it, if you are truthful.”",
3302,28,50,"But if they do not respond to you, then know that they only follow their desires. Who is more astray than one who follows his desire without any guidance from Allah? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.",
3303,28,51,"And We have constantly conveyed the Word [of admonition] to them[23], so that they may take heed.","[23] i.e., to the pagans of Makkah and the Jews from among the Children of Israel about the consequences of the doomed nations."
3304,28,52,"As for those whom We gave the Scripture before this [Qur’an], they[24] do believe in it.","[24] i.e., the sincere believers among the People of the Book."
3305,28,53,"When this [Qur’an] is recited to them, they say, “We believe in it, for it is the truth from our Lord. We had already submitted [as Muslims even] before this[25].”",[25] Such as ‘Abdullah ibn Salām and Salmān al-Fārisi.
3306,28,54,"They will be given their reward twice for their patience, repelling evil with good[26], and for spending out of what We have provided for them.","[26] i.e., compensating their misdeeds with good deeds, or responding to evil with what is good."
3307,28,55,"When they hear vain talk, they turn away from it and say, “We are accountable for our deeds and you for yours. Peace [is our response] to you[27]! We do not want [to be with] the ignorant.”","[27] i.e., ""You are secure from being treated in a like manner by us."""
3308,28,56,"You cannot guide whoever you like, but Allah guides whom He wills, and He knows best who will be guided.",
3309,28,57,"They say, “If we follow the guidance with you [O Prophet], we will be snatched away from our land[28].” Have We not established for them a safe sanctuary [in Makkah] to which fruits of all kinds are brought as provision from Us? But most of them do not know.",[28] By other Arab tribes.
3310,28,58,How many a town We have destroyed that were arrogant due to their affluence! Those are their dwellings which were never inhabited after them except briefly[29]. It is We Who were the Inheritors.,[29] By travelers of pagans of Makkah seeking temporary shelter.
3311,28,59,"Your Lord would never destroy towns without first sending to their main city a messenger, reciting to them Our verses. Nor would We destroy towns unless their people were wrongdoers.",
3312,28,60,"Whatever you have been given is only an enjoyment and adornment of the life of this world, but what is with Allah is better and more lasting. Will you not then understand?",
3313,28,61,"Is one whom We promised a good promise – which he is going to obtain – like one whom We gave the pleasure of the life of this world, then on the Day of Resurrection he will be among those summoned [to Hellfire]?",
3314,28,62,"And [beware of] the Day when He will call out to them and say, “Where are those whom you claimed to be My partners?”",
3315,28,63,"Those against whom the word will be fulfilled[30] will say, “Our Lord, these are the ones whom we led astray; we led them astray as we ourselves went astray. We disassociate ourselves [from them] before You; it was not us that they used to worship[31].”","[30] i.e., the disbelievers upon whom the decree of punishment has been passed.
 [31] i.e., We did not force them, nor did they obey us; rather, they obeyed their own desires."
3316,28,64,"Then they will be told, “Call upon your [so-called] partners [for help].” They will call upon them, but will receive no response. They will see the punishment, wishing that they had followed guidance.",
3317,28,65,"On the Day when He will call out to them, saying, “What response did you give to the messengers?”",
3318,28,66,"They will be dumbstruck[32] on that Day, not even able to ask one another.",[32] Not being able to make excuses or invent lies.
3319,28,67,"But whoever repents and believes, and does righteous deeds, he will be among the successful.",
3320,28,68,Your Lord creates and chooses what He wills; they have no choice. Glorified is Allah and Exalted is He far above what they associate with Him.,
3321,28,69,Your Lord knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal.,
3322,28,70,"He is Allah: none has the right to be worshiped except Him. All praise belongs to Him in this life and the Hereafter. His is the Judgment, and to Him you will all be returned.",
3323,28,71,"Say, “What do you think, if Allah were to make the night perpetual for you until the Day of Resurrection, which god other than Allah could bring you shining light? Do you not then listen?”",
3324,28,72,"Say, “What do you think, if Allah were to make the day perpetual for you until the Day of Resurrection, which god other than Allah could bring you night to rest in? Do you not then see?”",
3325,28,73,"It is out of His mercy that He made for you the night and day, so that you may rest therein and seek of His bounty, and so that you may be grateful.",
3326,28,74,"And [beware of] the Day when He will call out to them and say, “Where are those whom you claimed to be My partners?”",
3327,28,75,"We will bring forth from every nation a witness[33] and say, “Bring your proof.” They will then know that the truth is with Allah, and all [false gods] that they used to invent will be lost from them.","[33] i.e., a prophet."
3328,28,76,"Indeed, Korah[34] was one of the people of Moses, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. We had given him such treasures that their keys would weigh down a group of strong men. When his people said to him, “Do not exult, for Allah does not like the exultant.","[34] Korah was Moses’ cousin. Instead of helping his people, he behaved arrogantly toward them."
3329,28,77,"Rather, seek with what Allah has given you the abode of the Hereafter, without forgetting your share of this world, and do good as Allah has done good to you, and do not seek to spread corruption in the land, for Allah does not like those who spread corruption.”",
3330,28,78,"He said, “I have been given all this because of the knowledge that I have.” Did he not know that Allah destroyed some generations before him who were superior to him in power and greater in accumulating [wealth]? There will be no need for the wicked to be asked about their sins[35].",[35] Since Allah already knows their sins; they will only be interrogated as a form of censure and rebuke.
3331,28,79,"He came out before his people in all his glamor. Those who desired the life of this world said, “Oh, would that we had the like of what Korah has been given! He is indeed a man of great fortune.”",
3332,28,80,"But those who were given knowledge said, “Woe to you! Allah’s reward is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds. But none will attain this except those who are steadfast.”",
3333,28,81,"Then We caused the earth to swallow him and his house. There was no one to help him against Allah, nor was he able to help himself.",
3334,28,82,"Those who had wished for his position the day before started saying, “Oh, it is surely Allah Who extends provisions to whom He wills or restricts it. If Allah had not favored us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us too. Oh, indeed the disbelievers will never succeed.”",
3335,28,83,That is the abode of the Hereafter We will assign to those who neither seek superiority nor corruption on earth. The best outcome is for those who fear Allah.,
3336,28,84,"Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded with what is better, and whoever comes with an evil deed, the evildoers will only be recompensed for what they used to do.",
3337,28,85,"Indeed, the One Who has ordained for you the Qur’an will bring you back home[36]. Say, “My Lord knows best who has come with guidance and who is clearly misguided.”","[36] This is referring to the return of the Prophet (ﷺ) to Makkah after emigration to Medina, which did take place eventually as a conquerer."

The Prophet (ﷺ) had anticipated the offense and, upon advice from one of his companions, Salmān from Persia, dug a trench around the city to protect it from the invaders. After several attempts to cross the trench, the Allied forces lost morale and were forced to end the siege due to severe weather conditions.

Finally, he had a total of ten wives from the age of 53 until his death at the age of 63.

3727,36,22,Why should I not worship the One Who created me and to Whom you will all be brought back?,
3728,36,23,"Should I take besides Him other gods whose intercession cannot avail me in the least, nor can they come to my rescue, if the Most Compassionate wills to harm me?",
3729,36,24,Surely I would then be clearly misguided.,
3730,36,25,"I believe in your Lord, so listen to me.”",
3731,36,26,"[But they killed him], so he was told[6], “Enter Paradise.” He said, “If only my people knew[7]",[6] After he was martyred for the sake of Allah. [7] He said so after Allah admitted him into paradise and he saw the pleasures therein.
3732,36,27,"of how my Lord has forgiven me, and made me among the honored ones.”",
3733,36,28,"After his death, We did not send down any soldiers from heaven against his people, nor did We have to do so.",
3734,36,29,"It was no more than a single blast, and immediately they were extinguished.",
3735,36,30,Alas for the humans! No messenger ever comes to them but they ridicule him.,
3736,36,31,Do they not see how many generations We destroyed before them who will never come back to them[8]?,"[8] i.e., to the life of this world."
3737,36,32,Yet all of them will be brought before Us.,
3738,36,33,There is a sign for them in the dead land: We give it life and produce from it grain for them to eat.,
3739,36,34,"And We have made therein gardens of palm trees and grapevines, and caused springs to gush forth,",
3740,36,35,so that they may eat of its fruit that was not made by their hands[9]. Will they not then give thanks?,"[9] i.e., that which Allah has produced for them without labor on their part."
3741,36,36,"Glory be to the One Who created all types of things[10] that the earth produces, and of themselves, and of things that they have no knowledge about.","[10] i.e., all species, all things in pairs."
3742,36,37,"There is another sign for them in the night: We strip from it the daylight, and they are left in darkness.",
3743,36,38,"The sun is running to its determined course. That is the design of the All-Mighty, All-Knowing.",
3744,36,39,"As for the moon, We have determined phases for it, until it becomes like an old palm stalk.",
3745,36,40,"It is not for the sun to catch up with the moon, nor for the night to outstrip the day. Each is floating in its own orbit.",
3746,36,41,"Another sign for them is that We carried their offspring[11] in the loaded Ark,","[11] ""Dhurriyyah"" (lit., offspring); however, it is used here to denote ancestors (being the offspring of Noah) who were saved from the flood."
3747,36,42,and We created for them similar things on which they ride.,
3748,36,43,"If We willed, We could drown them, then there would be no one to respond to their cry, nor could they be rescued,",
3749,36,44,"except by a mercy from Us, leaving them to enjoy for a while.",
3750,36,45,"When it is said to them, “Beware of what is ahead of you and what is behind you[12], so that you may be shown mercy[13].”","[12] Of what awaits you in this life and in the Hereafter, or of the sins of the past and the future.
 [13] But they ignored the warning."
3751,36,46,No sign ever comes to them from their Lord except that they turn away from it.,
3752,36,47,"And when it is said to them, “Spend of what Allah has provided you with”, the disbelievers say to the believers, “Should we feed those whom Allah could feed if He willed? You are clearly misguided!”",
3753,36,48,"They say, “When will this promise come to pass, if you are truthful?”",
3754,36,49,They are not awaiting but a single Blast that will seize them while they are still disputing[14].,"[14] The first blast (lit., a cry or a shriek) of the Trumpet will take them by surprise on the Day of Judgment while they will be disputing in their worldly affairs."
3755,36,50,"Then they will not be able to make a will, nor will they be able to return to their households.",
3756,36,51,"The Trumpet will be blown[15] [again], and at once they will rush from their graves to their Lord.","[15] i.e., the second blast or blow."
3757,36,52,"They will say, “Woe to us! Who has resurrected us from our resting place?” [They will be told,] “This is what the Most Compassionate promised, and the messengers told the truth.”",
3758,36,53,"It will only be a single Blast, and at once they will all be brought before Us.",
3759,36,54,"On that Day no soul will be wronged in the least, nor will you be recompensed except for what you used to do.",
3760,36,55,"Indeed, on that Day the people of Paradise will be busy enjoying themselves,",
3761,36,56,they and their spouses will be reclining on couches in the shade.,
3762,36,57,They will have therein fruits and all what they ask for[16].,"[16] i.e., wish or desire."
3763,36,58,“Peace”: a word from a Most Merciful Lord.,
3764,36,59,"“Stand apart [from the believers] this Day, O wicked ones!",
3765,36,60,"Did I not command you, O children of Adam, not to worship Satan, for he is your sworn enemy,",
3766,36,61,but to worship Me? This is a straight path.,
3767,36,62,He had already misled great multitudes of you. Did you not then have sense?,
3768,36,63,This is the Hell that you were promised.,
3769,36,64,Burn in it Today for your disbelief[17].”,"[17] i.e., because you used to disbelieve."
3770,36,65,"Today We will seal up their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will testify to all what they used to do.",
3771,36,66,"If We willed, We could have taken away their sight, so they would rush to find their way, but then how could they see?",
3772,36,67,"And if We willed, We could have paralyzed them in their places[18], so they could neither move forward nor backward.","[18] i.e., We could turn them into inanimate objects."
3773,36,68,"Whomsoever We give a long life, We cause his strength to decline[19]. Do they not then understand?","[19] Humans are born weak, then they reach their prime when they are young, then they grow physically and mentally weak when they are old."
3774,36,69,"We have not taught him poetry, nor is it fitting for him. This is only a Reminder and a clear Qur’an",
3775,36,70,so that he may warn those who are truly alive[20] and establish the argument against the disbelievers.,"[20] In heart and mind, i.e., those who have faith."
3776,36,71,"Do they not see that We have created for them livestock made by Our Hands, and then they are their owners?",
3777,36,72,"And We have made them subservient to them; some they ride, and from others they eat,",
3778,36,73,and there are other benefits and drinks therein for them. Will they not then give thanks?,
3779,36,74,"Yet they have taken other gods besides Allah, hoping that they may be helped.",
3780,36,75,"They cannot help them, yet they serve them as their dedicated guards[21].",[21] Or their idols or so-called gods will be assembled to witness the punishment of their worshipers on the Day of Judgment.
3781,36,76,Do not let their words grieve you. Surely We know what they conceal and what they reveal.,
3782,36,77,"Does man not see that We have created him from a sperm-drop, then[22] he becomes a clear adversary,","[22] i.e., as soon as he becomes a self-sufficient being."
3783,36,78,"producing arguments[23] against Us while forgetting his own creation[24]. He says, “Who can give life to the bones after they have crumbled to dust?”","[23] Trying to prove that there is no life after death.
 [24] That we created him from dead matter to such an extent that he became now a clear disputant before Us."
3784,36,79,"Say, “The One Who created them in the first place will give life to them, for He has full knowledge of every created being;",
3785,36,80,"the One Who made for you fire out of the green tree, with which you kindle your fires[25].”","[25] It alludes to the ""markh"" and ""‘afār"" trees in Arabia, whose green branches if struck against each other, it produces sparks."
3786,36,81,"Is not the One Who created the heavens and earth able to create the like of these [people]? Yes indeed, for He is the Creator of all, the All-Knowing.",
3787,36,82,"Whenever He wills something to be, He only says to it, “Be”, and it is.",

3790,37,2,"and those who drive [the clouds],",
3791,37,3,"and those who recite Allah’s words[1],",[1] Allah swears by three kinds of angels in these three above-mentioned verses to emphasize what comes in the next verse.
3792,37,4,"indeed, your God is One,",
3793,37,5,"Lord of the heavens and earth and all that is between them, and Lord of the points of sunrise.",

3798,37,10,"except who stealthily snatches away some words, he will be pursued by a piercing flame.",

3800,37,12,"Rather you are astonished, while they ridicule it,",
3801,37,13,"and when they are reminded, they pay no heed,",
3802,37,14,"and when they see a sign, they ridicule it,",
3803,37,15,"and they say, “This is nothing but clear magic.",
3804,37,16,"Is it that when we are dead and become dust and bones, will we really be raised up again,",
3805,37,17,and our forefathers too?”,
3806,37,18,"Say, “Yes, and you will be disgraced.”",
3807,37,19,"It will only be a single Blast[4], and at once they will be looking around.","[4] i.e., the second blow of the Trumpet."
3808,37,20,"They will say, “Woe to us! This is the Day of Judgment!”",
3809,37,21,"[They will be told], “This is the Day of Decision that you used to deny.”",
3810,37,22,"[The angels will be told], “Gather all those who did wrong and their fellows[5], and whatever they used to worship",[5] In wrongdoing or evil deeds.
3811,37,23,"besides Allah, and lead them to the way of Hell,",
3812,37,24,"and stop them, for they are to be questioned.”",
3813,37,25,"[They will be asked], “What is the matter with you, that you no longer help one another?”",
3814,37,26,Rather on that Day they will surrender completely.,
3815,37,27,"They will turn to one another, reproaching one another.",
3816,37,28,"[The followers] will say, “It was you who used to delude us from the right way[6].”","[6] Or you used to pressure us, or deceived us with false oaths, or claimed to have the truth."
3817,37,29,"[The misleaders] will say, “Rather, you yourselves were not believers,",
3818,37,30,"and We had no power over you, rather you yourselves were a transgressing people.",
3819,37,31,Now the punishment of our Lord has come true against us; we will surely taste it.,
3820,37,32,"We did misguide you, for we ourselves were misguided”.",
3821,37,33,On that Day they will all share in the punishment.,
3822,37,34,"This is how We deal with the wicked,",
3823,37,35,"for whenever it was said to them, “None has the right to be worshiped except Allah,” they became arrogant,",
3824,37,36,"and said, “Are we going to abandon our gods for a mad poet[7]?”",[7] They mean the Prophet (ﷺ).
3825,37,37,"Rather, he came with the truth and confirmed the messengers.",
3826,37,38,"You will surely taste the painful punishment,",
3827,37,39,"and you will only be recompensed for what you used to do,",
3828,37,40,except the chosen slaves of Allah.,
3829,37,41,"They will have a known provision,",
3830,37,42,fruits[8]; and they will be honored,"[8] i.e., everything delicious that they desire."
3831,37,43,"in Gardens of Bliss,",
3832,37,44,facing one another[9] on couches.,[9] It implies that they will not harbor ill feelings toward one another.
3833,37,45,"They will be served with a cup of wine from a flowing stream,",
3834,37,46,white and delicious for those who drink.,
3835,37,47,"It will cause no harm, nor will they be intoxicated by it,",
3836,37,48,"and with them will be maidens of modest gaze[10] and beautiful eyes,","[10] i.e., chaste and bashful, looking only at their mates."
3837,37,49,as if they were well-protected eggs[11].,[11] Or pristine pearls.
3838,37,50,Then they will turn to one another asking[12].,[12] Of their lives in the world and what led them to Paradise.
3839,37,51,"One of them will say, “I had a close friend [in the world]",
3840,37,52,"who used to say[13], ‘Are you one of those who believe",[13] Mockingly.
3841,37,53,"that when we die and become dust and bones, shall we be brought for judgment?’”",
3842,37,54,"He will say[14], “Do you wish to see [his fate]?”",[14] To his companions in Paradise.
3843,37,55,So he will look down and see him[15] in the midst of the Blazing Fire.,[15] His close friend who tried to dissuade him from faith.
3844,37,56,"He will say, “By Allah, you were about to ruin me.",
3845,37,57,"Were it not for the grace of my Lord, I would have been among those who are brought [to Hell].”",
3846,37,58,"[He will say to his fellow believers], “Are we not going to die anymore,",
3847,37,59,"except for our first death, nor are we going to be punished?”",
3848,37,60,This is indeed the supreme triumph!,
3849,37,61,For such [reward] let the workers work.,
3850,37,62,Is this a better accommodation or the tree of Zaqqūm[16]?[17],"[16] The tree of cactus.
 [17] The disbelievers of Makkah derided the Prophet (ﷺ) when he warned them of this tree. They wondered how a tree could grow in Hellfire. So Allah revealed this verse."
3851,37,63,We have made it a trial for the wrongdoers.,
3852,37,64,It is a tree that grows in the bottom of the Blazing Fire;,
3853,37,65,its fruits are like heads of devils.,
3854,37,66,"They will certainly eat from it, filling their bellies.",
3855,37,67,"Then on top of that they will be given a mixture of scalding water,",
3856,37,68,then their final return will be to the Blazing Fire.,
3857,37,69,"For they found their forefathers astray,",
3858,37,70,so they rushed to follow in their footsteps.,
3859,37,71,"Indeed, most of the earlier people went astray before them,",
3860,37,72,even though We sent among them warners.,
3861,37,73,"Then see how was the end of those who were warned,",
3862,37,74,except the chosen slaves of Allah.,
3863,37,75,"Indeed, Noah called upon Us; how excellent are We at responding!",
3864,37,76,"And We saved him and his household[18] from the great distress,","[18] i.e., the believers in his household."
3865,37,77,"and made his offspring[19] the only survivors,","[19] i.e., Noah’s offspring: Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
3866,37,78,and We left for him [a favorable mention] among later generations:,
3867,37,79,“Peace be upon Noah among all the nations.”,
3868,37,80,This is how We reward those who do good.,
3869,37,81,He was one of Our believing slaves.,
3870,37,82,Then we drowned the others.,
3871,37,83,"Indeed, Abraham was one of those who followed his way.",
3872,37,84,"When he came to his Lord with a sound heart,",
3873,37,85,"and said to his father and his people, “What are you worshiping?",
3874,37,86,Is it false gods that you seek other than Allah?,
3875,37,87,Then what do you think of the Lord of the worlds?”,
3876,37,88,"He then cast a glance at the stars[20],","[20] His people had faith in astrology, so Abraham pretended to do the same to show them that he was not able to join them at their pagan feast and to remain in their temple of idols, while he was planning to destroy their idols."
3877,37,89,"and said, “I am sick[21].”","[21] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Ibrahim (peace be upon him) did not lie except for three lies: His saying {I am sick} and his saying {Rather, the chief of them did this} and his saying about his wife, “She is my sister.” [Al-Bukhāri, Muslim]. Two of them were for the sake of Allah, and the third one was for the sake of his sister."
3878,37,90,So they went away from him and left.,
3879,37,91,"Then he turned to their gods and said, “Why do you not eat[22]?",[22] The offerings placed before you.
3880,37,92,What is wrong with you that you do not speak?”,
3881,37,93,"Then he turned upon them, striking them with his right hand.",
3882,37,94,Then his people came rushing towards him.,
3883,37,95,"He said, “Do you worship what you yourselves carve,",
3884,37,96,when it is Allah Who created you and all what you do?”,
3885,37,97,"They said, “Build a pyre for him and throw him into the blazing fire.”",
3886,37,98,"They contrived a plan against him, but We made them the lowest.",
3887,37,99,"He said, “I am going to my Lord; He will guide me.",
3888,37,100,"My Lord, grant me righteous offspring.”",
3889,37,101,So We gave him glad tidings of a forbearing boy[23].,"[23] i.e., Ishmael"
3890,37,102,"Then when he reached the age where he could work with him, Abraham said, “O my dear son, I have seen in a dream that I must sacrifice you. What do you think?” He said, “O my dear father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, if Allah wills, one of the steadfast.”",
3891,37,103,"When they both submitted [to Allah’s command] and Abraham laid him on his forehead,",
3892,37,104,"and We called out to him, “O Abraham,",
3893,37,105,You have fulfilled the dream.” This is how We reward those who do good.,
3894,37,106,This was indeed a revealing test.,
3895,37,107,"And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice[24],",[24] Allah Almighty sent a ram to be sacrificed in place of Ishmael.
3896,37,108,and We left for him [a favorable mention] among later generations:,
3897,37,109,“Peace be upon Abraham.”,
3898,37,110,This is how We reward those who do good.,
3899,37,111,He was one of Our believing slaves.,
3900,37,112,"And We gave him the glad tidings of Isaac[25], a prophet, and one of the righteous.","[25] The birth of Isaac is mentioned after the story of sacrifice, which verifies that the firstborn son who was sacrificed was indeed Ishmael and not Isaac, contrary to what is claimed by the Jews and Christians. This is also supported by 11:71, where Sarah is told that she would give birth to Isaac, who would have a son by the name of Jacob."
3901,37,113,"We blessed him[26] and Isaac, but among their offspring were some who did good and some who clearly wronged themselves.",[26] Abraham or Ishmael.
3902,37,114,"Indeed, We bestowed Our favor upon Moses and Aaron,",
3903,37,115,"and We saved them and their people from the great distress[27],","[27] Of enslavement at the hands of Pharaoh and his people, as well as of drowning."
3904,37,116,"and We helped them, so they were victorious,",
3905,37,117,"and We gave them both the clear Scripture,",
3906,37,118,and guided them to the straight path;,
3907,37,119,and We left for them [a favorable mention] among later generations:,
3908,37,120,“Peace be upon Moses and Aaron.”,
3909,37,121,This is how We reward those who do good.,
3910,37,122,They were truly of Our believing slaves.,
3911,37,123,Elijah was indeed one of the messengers.,
3912,37,124,When he said to his people: “Do you not fear Allah?,
3913,37,125,"Do you call upon Ba‘l[28] and ignore the Best of the Creators,",[28] A great idol worshiped by the people.
3914,37,126,"Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers?”",
3915,37,127,"But they rejected him, so they will surely be brought [for punishment],",
3916,37,128,except the chosen slaves of Allah.,
3917,37,129,And We left for him [a favorable mention] among later generations:,
3918,37,130,“Peace be upon Elias.”,
3919,37,131,This is how We reward those who do good.,
3920,37,132,He was one of Our believing slaves.,
3921,37,133,Lot was indeed one of the messengers.,
3922,37,134,"When We saved him and all of his household,",
3923,37,135,except an old woman[29] who was among those who stayed behind.,"[29] Lot’s wife, who was not a believer."
3924,37,136,Then We destroyed the rest.,
3925,37,137,You [Makkans] pass by their ruins by day,
3926,37,138,and by night. Do you still not understand?,
3927,37,139,Jonah was indeed one of the messengers.,
3928,37,140,"When he fled to the fully laden ship,",
3929,37,141,"then he cast lots[30] with them, but was among those who lost.","[30] To determine who would be cast overboard in order to save the rest of the passengers; the ship was about to sink, for it was overloaded."
3930,37,142,The whale then swallowed him while he was blameworthy[31].,[31] For leaving his people without Allah’s permission.
3931,37,143,"Were it not for the fact that he was one of those who glorify Allah,",
3932,37,144,he would have stayed in its belly until the Day of Resurrection[32].,[32] The belly of the fish would have turned to be his grave.
3933,37,145,"But We cast him ashore on a barren land while he was ill,",
3934,37,146,and caused a gourd vine[33] to grow over him.,[33] For its cooling shade and as food for him.
3935,37,147,"We sent him[34] to one hundred thousand people or more,","[34] i.e., We sent him thereafter to his people."
3936,37,148,"and they believed, so We let them enjoy for a while.",
3937,37,149,"So ask them, “Does your Lord have daughters while they have sons?”[35]","[35] The pagans of Makkah claimed that angels were Allah’s daughters, while preferring sons for themselves."
3938,37,150,Or did We create the angels as females while they were watching?,
3939,37,151,"No indeed, it is one of their fabrications when they say,",
3940,37,152,"“Allah has children,” and they are truly liars.",
3941,37,153,Did He choose daughters over sons[36]?,"[36] i.e., daughters that you hate over sons that you like?"
3942,37,154,What is the matter with you? How do you judge?,
3943,37,155,Will you not then take heed?,
3944,37,156,Do you have any compelling proof?,
3945,37,157,"Then bring your scripture, if you are truthful.",
3946,37,158,"They claim that there is a kinship between Him and the jinn[37], when the jinn themselves know that such people will surely be brought [for punishment].",[37] It was claimed by some Arab pagans that angels are daughters of Allah through female jinn.
3947,37,159,Glorified is Allah far above what they ascribe [to Him].,

3990,38,20,We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and sound judgment [and speech].,
3991,38,21,"Has there come to you the story of the adversaries, when they climbed the wall of his chamber?",
3992,38,22,"When they entered upon David, he was frightened. They said, “Do not be afraid. We are two adversaries: one of us has wronged the other, so judge between us with fairness, and do not be unjust, and guide us to the straight path.",

3994,38,24,"David said, “He has certainly wronged you by demanding that your ewe be added to his flock. Indeed, many partners oppress one another, except those who believe and do righteous deeds – and how few they are.” Then David realized that We were only testing him, so he asked his Lord for forgiveness[13], fell down bowing, and turned to Him in repentance.",[13] For fear of the two men or the misjudgment he made.
3995,38,25,"So We forgave that for him, and he certainly has a place of nearness to Us and a good place of return.",

4001,38,31,"One evening, well-trained and swift horses of noble breed were presented before him.",
4002,38,32,"He then said, “I gave preference to the love of fine things over the remembrance of my Lord,” until the sun went out of sight.",
4003,38,33,"[He ordered], “Bring them back to me,” and he began striking [their] shanks and necks[14].","[14] With his sword as expiation, for it might have been permissible in their law, especially if it had been for the sake of Allah such as missing prayer or the like; this is a more correct view. However, Ibn Jarīr favored the view that Solomon began to rub down their legs and necks with the hand, not by the sword."
4004,38,34,"Indeed, We tested Solomon and cast upon his throne a body, then he turned [to Allah][15].","[15] The Prophet (ﷺ) said that one night Solomon said that each one of his wives would conceive a boy who would fight for the sake of Allah. He forgot to say ‘Allah willing,’ so only one of them gave birth to a deformed, dead baby. So Solomon sought Allah’s forgiveness. [Al-Bukhāri]"
4005,38,35,"He said, “My Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom, the like of which will never be granted to anyone after me. You are indeed the Bestower.”",
4006,38,36,"So We subjected to him the wind blowing gently by his command to wherever he wished,",

4012,38,42,"[Allah said], “Stamp [the ground] with your foot: here is a cool spring for bathing and drinking.”",
4013,38,43,And We restored his family to him and the like of them[18] as a mercy from Us and as a reminder for people of understanding.,"[18] When Allah granted him health, the whole family returned to him and he was granted even more children."
4014,38,44,"[We said], “Take a bunch of grass in your hand, and strike [your wife] with it, and do not break your oath[19].” We truly found him patient – an excellent and faithful slave he was. He constantly turned [to Us].","[19] When Job was afflicted with illness, everyone abandoned him except his wife. Once he became angry with her and vowed to punish her with one hundred lashes if he recovered. According to Allah's instruction, the oath was fulfilled by striking her once with one hundred blades of grass without harming his wife."
4015,38,45,"Remember Our slaves: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob – men of strength and insight.",

4034,38,64,This is certainly true that the people of the Fire will dispute among themselves.,

4256,41,38,"But if they show arrogance, then those [angels] who are with your Lord glorify Him night and day, and they never grow weary.",
4257,41,39,"And among His signs is that you see the land withered, but when We send down rain upon it, it stirs and swells. He Who gives it life will surely give life to the dead, for He is Most Capable of all things.",
4258,41,40,"Those who seek to cause deviation in Our verses[16] are not hidden from Us. Is one who will be cast into the Fire better or one who will come safely on the Day of Resurrection? Do whatever you wish, for He is All-Seeing of what you do.","[16] By denying them, distorting their meanings, preferring deviant interpretation, or making noise while they are recited as the pagans of Makkah used to do."
4259,41,41,"Those who disbelieve in the Reminder[17] when it comes to them [will be punished], for it is truly a mighty Book[18].","[17] i.e., the Qur’an.
 [18] Inimitable and protected by Allah from any distortion or alteration."
4260,41,42,"No falsehood can approach it from the front or from behind; a revelation from the One Who is All-Wise, Praiseworthy.",
4261,41,43,"Nothing is said to you [O Prophet] except what was already said to the messengers before you. Indeed, your Lord is All-Forgiving, but Severe in punishment.",
4262,41,44,"If We had made it a non-Arabic Qur’an, they would have said, “If only its verses were made clear? What! A non-Arabic [book] and an Arab [messenger]?” Say, “It is a guidance and healing for those who believe. As for those who do not believe, there is deafness in their ears and they are blind to [understand] it – it is as if they are being called from a far-off place[19].”",[19] So they neither hear the call nor understand it.
4263,41,45,"We gave Moses the Scripture, but differences arose concerning it. Were it not for a prior decree[20] from your Lord, it would have been judged between them. Surely they are in a disquieting doubt about it.",[20] That Allah will delay their judgment until Judgment Day.
4264,41,46,"Whoever does a righteous deed, it is to his own benefit; and whoever does an evil deed, it is to his own loss. Your Lord is not unjust to His slaves.",
4265,41,47,"The knowledge of the Hour is with Him alone. No fruit emerges from its husk, nor does any female conceive or give birth without His knowledge. On the Day when He will call them, “Where are My [alleged] partners?” They will say, “We declare before you that none of us can bear witness to that.”",
4266,41,48,"Whatever they used to supplicate before will vanish from them, and they will realize that they have no escape.",
4267,41,49,"Man never tires of asking for good, but if evil touches him, he is desperate and despondent.",
4268,41,50,"But if We give him a taste of mercy from Us after being inflicted with adversity, he will surely say, “This is my due[21], and I do not think that the Hour will ever come, but if I am brought back to my Lord, I will surely have with Him the best [reward].” We will surely inform the disbelievers of what they did, and We will surely make them taste a harsh punishment.","[21] For I deserve it for my effort, knowledge, excellence, etc."
4269,41,51,"When We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and distances himself [from Us]; but when evil touches him, he is full of prolonged supplication.",
4270,41,52,"Say, “Did you ever consider, if this [Qur’an] is really from Allah, but you reject it, who can be more astray than someone who is in extreme defiance?”",
4271,41,53,We will show them Our signs in the universe and in their own selves until it becomes clear to them that this [Qur’an] is the truth[22]. Is it not enough that your Lord is a Witness over all things?,[22] Or that He is the Truth.

4277,42,5,"The heavens almost burst apart above them[2], and the angels glorify the praises of their Lord and seek forgiveness for those on earth. Indeed, Allah is the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.","[2] i.e., from the grandeur of Allah Almighty and in awe of Him."
4278,42,6,"As for those who take others as protectors besides Him, Allah is Watchful over them, and you[3] are not a keeper over them.",[3] O Prophet (ﷺ).
4279,42,7,"Thus We have revealed to you an Arabic Qur’an, so that you may warn the Mother Town[4] and all those around it[5], and warn them of the Day of Gathering, about which there is no doubt; one party will be in Paradise and the other in the Blaze.","[4] “The Mother Town” is an honorary title of Makkah for its great religious significance where Allah’s first house of worship was ever built on earth, and perhaps for its central location on earth as well. [MDCI]
 [5] i.e., and then all other people."
4280,42,8,"If Allah had willed, He would have made all of them a single community, but He admits to His mercy whom He wills[6], and the wrongdoers will have no protector or helper.","[6] i.e., those of His slaves who desire His guidance and His acceptance of them."
4281,42,9,"How do they take protectors besides Him? While Allah alone is the Protector, for He gives life to the dead, and He is Most Capable of all things.",
4282,42,10,"Whatever you may differ about, it is for Allah to judge. Such is Allah, my Lord; in Whom I put my trust, and to Whom I turn[7],",[7] In repentance and remembering Him.
4283,42,11,"the Originator of the heavens and earth. He has given you spouses of your own kind, and pairs of livestock; by which He causes you to multiply. There is nothing like unto Him[8], and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.","[8] In His essence, His attributes, or His deeds."
4284,42,12,"To Him belong the keys of the heavens and earth; He extends provision to whom He wills or restricts it. Indeed, He is All-Knowing of all things.",
4285,42,13,"He has prescribed for you [believers] the same religion which He enjoined upon Noah, and that which We have revealed to you [O Prophet] and that which We enjoined upon Abraham, Moses, and Jesus[9]: “You should uphold the religion and make no divisions therein.” What you are calling the polytheists to is very hard for them. Allah chooses for Himself whom He wills and guides to Himself who turns to Him.","[9] This verse is naming the five greatest prophets of Allah (the prophets of the firm resolve): Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad. See also 33:7."
4286,42,14,"They did not become divided except after the knowledge had come to them[10], out of envious rivalry between them. Were it not for a prior decree from your Lord until an appointed term[11], a decisive judgment would already have been passed between them. Indeed, those who inherited the Scripture[12] after them are in disquieting doubt about it.","[10] No community split into factions except after receiving the knowledge given to them by their prophet, out of transgression and obstinacy towards the truth.
 [11] That He will delay their punishment to the judgment Day.
 [12] i.e., the Jews and the Christians."
4287,42,15,"Therefore call to that [religion, O Prophet] and keep to the straight path as you are commanded, and do not follow their desires, and say, “I believe in every Scripture that Allah has sent down, and I have been commanded to judge fairly among you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We have our deeds and you have your deeds[13]. Let there be no [further] argument between us and you[14]; Allah will bring us together, and to Him is the final return.”","[13] i.e., the consequences thereof.
 [14] Since the truth and falsehood have become clear, but those who refuse the truth do so only out of obstinacy or pursuing worldly interests."
4288,42,16,"As for those who argue about [the religion of] Allah after it has been accepted [by many][15], their argument carries no weight with their Lord; they have incurred [His] wrath, and for them there will be severe punishment.",[15] In an attempt to turn the believers away from His religion.
4289,42,17,It is Allah Who has sent down the Book with the truth and justice. How could you know that perhaps the Hour is near?,
4290,42,18,"Those who disbelieve in it seek to hasten it[16], but those who believe are apprehensive about it and know that it is the truth. Indeed, those who dispute concerning the Hour have gone far astray.",[16] They challenged the Prophet (ﷺ) to bring the Hour on them immediately without delay.
4291,42,19,"Allah is Kind to His slaves; He gives provision to whom He wills, and He is the All-Powerful, the All-Mighty.",
4292,42,20,"Whoever seeks the harvest of the Hereafter, We will increase for him his harvest; and whoever seeks the harvest of this world, We will give him thereof, but in the Hereafter he will have no share.",
4293,42,21,"Or do they have partners who have prescribed for them a religion that is not sanctioned by Allah? If it had not been for a prior decisive decree, the matter would have been judged between them. And for the wrongdoers there will surely be a painful punishment.",
4294,42,22,"You will see the wrongdoers apprehensive about what they have earned, which will inevitably befall them. But those who believe and do righteous deeds will be in meadows of the Gardens. They will have whatever they wish with their Lord; that is the great bounty.",
4295,42,23,"That is the glad tidings that Allah gives to His slaves who believe and do righteous deeds. Say, “I do not ask you any reward for it, except kindness because of our kinship[17].” Whoever does a good deed, We will increase its merit for him. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative.","[17] Or true love for Allah by pursuing deeds that bring you close to Allah, or showing love and respect to the immediate household of the Prophet (ﷺ)."
4296,42,24,"Or do they say, “He has fabricated lies about Allah[18]!”? But if Allah willed, He could seal up your heart[19]. Allah wipes out falsehood and establishes the truth by His Words. Indeed, He is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts.","[18] While they are certain of his truthfulness and honesty.
 [19] Allah could seal up the whole message by sealing up his heart; then he would not understand anything, so the whole message would then stop if He so willed."
4297,42,25,"It is He Who accepts repentance from His slaves and pardons sins, and He knows all what you do.",
4298,42,26,"He responds to [the supplication of] those who believe and do righteous deeds and increases their reward out of His bounty. But for the disbelievers, there will be a severe punishment.",
4299,42,27,"If Allah were to give abundant provision to [all] His slaves, they would transgress on earth; but He sends down what He wills in due measure. Indeed, He is All-Aware and All-Seeing of His slaves.",
4300,42,28,"It is He Who sends down rain after they have lost hope, and spreads His mercy. He is the Guardian, the Praiseworthy.",
4301,42,29,"Among His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth, and what He spread between them of all living creatures. And He is Most Capable of bringing them together whenever He wills.",

4303,42,31,"You cannot escape [Him] on earth, and you do not have besides Allah any protector or helper.",
4304,42,32,"And among His signs are the ships, sailing in the sea like mountains.",
4305,42,33,"If He wills, He can still the wind, leaving the ships motionless on its surface. Indeed, there are signs in this for everyone who is steadfast and grateful.",
4306,42,34,"Or He can capsize them[20] for what they committed, but He pardons much,","[20] i.e., He could sink the ships by violent winds."
4307,42,35,then those who dispute concerning Our signs will know that they have no escape.,
4308,42,36,"Whatever you have been given is but a short enjoyment of the life of this world, but what is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord;",
4309,42,37,"and those who avoid major sins and shameful deeds, and when they are angered, they forgive;",
4310,42,38,"and those who respond to their Lord and establish prayer, and conduct their affairs by mutual consultation, and spend out of what We have provided for them;",
4311,42,39,and those who retaliate fairly when oppressed[21].,"[21] Restoring their rights to preserve their honor and dignity, especially if the oppressor does not deserve remission, or it does not serve any interest."
4312,42,40,"The retribution of harm is its equivalent harm, but whoever pardons and seeks reconciliation, his reward is with Allah. Indeed, He does not like the wrongdoers.",
4313,42,41,"But whoever retaliates after being wronged, there is no blame on them.",
4314,42,42,Blame is only on those who wrong people and transgress in the land without right. For such there will be a painful punishment.,
4315,42,43,"But whoever observes patience and forgives, it is indeed a matter of great resolve[22].",[22] On the part of those seeking Allah’s reward; none can be guided to this except those whom Allah blessed with great merit.
4316,42,44,"Whoever Allah causes to stray, he will have no protector thereafter. You will see the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying, “Is there any way to go back?”",
4317,42,45,"You will see them exposed to the Fire in a state of abject humiliation, looking with a stealthy glance. Those who believed will say, “The real losers are those who have lost themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection.” Indeed, the wrongdoers will suffer an everlasting punishment.",
4318,42,46,"They will have no protectors to help them against Allah; whoever Allah causes to stray, there is no way [to guidance] for him.",
4319,42,47,"Respond to your Lord before there comes from Allah a Day that cannot be averted. On that Day you will have no refuge, nor will you be able to deny [your sins].",
4320,42,48,"But if they turn away, We have not sent you as their keeper; your duty is only to convey the message. If We give man a taste of Our mercy, he exults in it; but when a calamity befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth, then man becomes totally ungrateful.",
4321,42,49,"To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth. He creates what He wills; He grants females to whom He wills and grants males to whom He wills,",
4322,42,50,"or grants them males and females; and He leaves whom He wills barren. Indeed, He is All-Knowing, Most Capable.",
4323,42,51,"It is not for a human being that Allah should speak to him except through revelation or from behind a veil, or by sending an angel-messenger to reveal what He wills by His permission. Indeed, He is Most High, All-Wise.",
4324,42,52,"Likewise, We have revealed to you a revelation by Our command. You knew nothing of the Scripture or matters of faith, but We have made it [i.e., the Qur’an] a light by which We guide whom We will of Our slaves. And you are truly leading people to a straight path,",
4325,42,53,"the path of Allah, to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. Indeed, to Allah return all matters.",

4329,43,4,"and it is in the Master Book[2] with us, highly esteemed, full of wisdom.","[2] i.e., the Preserved Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfūz)."
4330,43,5,Should We then turn the Reminder[3] away from you simply because you are a transgressing people?,"[3] i.e., the Qur’an."
4331,43,6,How many a prophet did We send to the earlier peoples!,
4332,43,7,No prophet ever came to them except that they ridiculed him.,
4333,43,8,"So We destroyed them, although they were greater in might than these [Pagans][4], and the stories of the earlier nations have already been related[5].","[4] Of the Quraysh.
 [5] Such as the people of Noah, Lot, Shu’ayb and other nations who were destroyed."
4334,43,9,"If you ask them, “Who created the heavens and earth?”, they will surely say, “The All-Mighty, the All-Knowing created them.”",

4336,43,11,"And it is He Who sends down rain from the sky in due measure, by which We revive dead land. This is how you will be brought forth [from the grave].",
4337,43,12,"And it is He Who created all pair of things[6], and made for you ships and animals on which you ride,","[6] Such as male and female, sweet and bitter, day and night, mountains and plains, hot and cold, light and darkness."
4338,43,13,"so that you may settle yourselves on their backs, then remember the blessings of your Lord when you have settled thereupon and say, “Glory be to Him Who has subjected this for us, for we could not have done it by ourselves[7].","[7] Lit., ""made it a companion"" or ""made it compatible."""
4339,43,14,It is to our Lord that we will surely return.”,
4340,43,15,"Yet they ascribe to Him some of His slaves as offspring[8]. Indeed, man is clearly ungrateful.","[8] By falsely claiming that Allah has a son or daughters, which are the allegations of disbelievers and polytheists."
4341,43,16,"Has He taken for Himself daughters from what He has created, and favored you with sons?",
4342,43,17,"When one of them is given tidings of [a baby girl] the like of which he ascribes to the Most Compassionate, his face darkens as he suppresses his rage.",
4343,43,18,Or [do they ascribe to Allah] one who is brought up in adornments and is not able to present a clear argument in disputation?,
4344,43,19,"They regard the angels, who are slaves of the Most Compassionate, as female. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be written, and they will be questioned!",
4345,43,20,"They say, “If the Most Compassionate had willed, we would not have worshiped them.” They have no knowledge of that; they do nothing but conjecture.",
4346,43,21,"Or have We given them a Book before this [Qur’an], to which they are holding fast?",
4347,43,22,"They rather say, “We found our forefathers on a path, and we are seeking guidance in their footsteps.”",
4348,43,23,"Likewise, We never sent any warner to a town before you except that its affluent ones said, “We found our forefathers on a path, and we are following their footsteps.”",
4349,43,24,"[The warner] said, “Even if I bring you a better guidance than what you have found your forefathers upon?” They said, “We totally reject what you [prophets] have been sent with.”",
4350,43,25,So We took revenge on them; see what was the end of the deniers!,
4351,43,26,"And [remember] when Abraham said to his father and his people, “I disown all that you worship,",
4352,43,27,except the One Who created me; He will surely guide me.”,
4353,43,28,"And he made it[9] a lasting word among his descendants, so that they may return [to Allah].","[9] i.e., his testimony of faith that none has the right to be worshiped except Allah."
4354,43,29,"However, I let these [Makkans] and their forefathers[10] enjoy their lives, until there came to them the truth and a clear messenger[11].","[10] i.e., the descendants of Abraham (ﷺ).
 [11] i.e., Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)."
4355,43,30,"But when the truth came to them, they said, “This is magic, and we definitely reject it.”",
4356,43,31,"And they said, “Why was this Qur’an not sent down to a great man from one of the two towns[12]?”","[12] i.e., Makkah and its neighboring town; Tā’if."
4357,43,32,"Is it they who distribute the mercy of your Lord? It is We Who have distributed their livelihood among them in the life of this world, and have raised some of them above others in ranks, so that they may serve one another. But the mercy of your Lord is better than what they accumulate.",
4358,43,33,"Were it not that all people might become a single community [of disbelievers][13], We would have given those who disbelieve in the Most Compassionate One houses of sliver roofs and staircases to ascend,",[13] Assuming that Allah’s generosity to them was a sign of His approval.
4359,43,34,"and their houses having [silver] doors and couches on which they recline,",
4360,43,35,"and [golden] ornaments. But all of these are mere enjoyments of the life of this world, and the Hereafter with your Lord is [only] for those who fear Allah.",
4361,43,36,"Whoever turns away from the Reminder of the Most Compassionate [i.e., the Qur’an], We assign to him a devil to be his close associate,",
4362,43,37,"who will surely avert them from the [right] way, while they think that they are rightly guided.",
4363,43,38,"Then when he comes to Us, he will say [to his devil associate], “I wish you were as distant from me as the East and West. What a terrible associate [you were]!”",
4364,43,39,"[They will be told], “As you have done wrong, it will not benefit you Today that you are sharing the punishment[14].”","[14] In the life of this world, it is comforting to many people when they hear that others also went through similar trials. However, this will not be the case on Judgment Day, as everyone will be desperate to save themselves, regardless of what happens to others."
4365,43,40,"Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the blind or the one who is clearly misguided?",
4366,43,41,"Either We take you away [in death], We will surely exact retribution upon them,",
4367,43,42,"or We will show you what We warned them of, for We have full power over them.",

4369,43,44,"This [Qur’an] is surely a glory[15] for you and your people, and you will [all] be questioned.","[15] i.e., an honor or a reminder."
4370,43,45,Ask those of Our messengers whom We sent before you: Did We appoint gods to be worshiped besides the Most Compassionate?,
4371,43,46,"Indeed, We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his courtiers, so he said: “I am a messenger of the Lord of the worlds.”",
4372,43,47,"But as soon as he came to them with Our signs, they laughed at them.",
4373,43,48,"Every sign We showed them was greater than the one before it[16], and We seized them with punishment[17] so that they may turn in repentance.","[16] i.e., the bright hand and the staff turning into a serpent. See 20:17-22.

4374,43,49,"They said, “O magician, call upon your Lord for us, by virtue of the covenant He has made with you[18]; we will surely accept guidance.”",[18] See 7:134.
4375,43,50,"But as soon We removed the punishment from them, they broke their promise.",
4376,43,51,"Pharaoh proclaimed to his people, “O my people, does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me, and these streams[19] flowing at my feet? Do you not see?","[19] i.e., branches of the Nile River."
4377,43,52,Or am I not better than this contemptible one who can hardly express himself[20]?,"[20] Moses had a speech impediment prior to his mission. However, when he became a prophet he asked Allah to remove his impediment, and his prayer was answered. See 20:25-36."
4378,43,53,Then why are there not sent down upon him bracelets of gold or come with him angels to support him?”,
4379,43,54,Thus he made a fool of his people and they obeyed him. They were indeed a wicked people.,
4380,43,55,"When they angered Us, We exacted Our retribution and drowned them all.",
4381,43,56,Thus We made them a precedent and a lesson[21] for the later generations.,"[21] A precedent for those who do not learn any lesson from their example, and a lesson for those who are keen to learn a lesson."
4382,43,57,"When the example of the son of Mary was given, your people laughed and jeered[22],","[22] When 21:98 was revealed, warning the pagans that all what they worship besides Allah will be in Hell, a poet who was a staunch enemy of Islam, Abdullah ibn az-Ziba‘ra, along with other pagans jeered and laughed arguing that Jesus will be in Hell as well! The Prophet (ﷺ) replied that the verse was talking exclusively about idols, adding that Jesus himself did not ask to be worshiped. Verse 21:101 was later revealed in support of the Prophet declaring that they are exempted."
4383,43,58,"and they said, “Are Our gods better or he[23]?” They only mentioned him to you for the sake of argument. They are indeed a contentious people.","[23] i.e., Jesus."

4488,45,15,"Whoever does a righteous deed, it is for his own benefit; and whoever does an evil deed, it is to his own loss. Then to your Lord you will be returned.",
4489,45,16,"Indeed, We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood; provided them with good things; and favored them above all others[4].",[4] By sending them numerous prophets from among the descendants of Abraham.
4490,45,17,"We gave them clear directions in matters [of religion]. They did not differ except after the knowledge had come to them out of transgression against one another[5]. Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning their differences.",[5] No community split into factions until there came to them a prophet with divine knowledge; some of them believed and most of them disbelieved out of arrogance and pursuit of worldly benefits.
4491,45,18,Then We put you [O Prophet] on a clear way of the religion; so follow it and do not follow the desires of those who have no knowledge.,
4492,45,19,"They cannot avail you at all against Allah. Indeed, the wrongdoers are protectors of one another, whereas Allah is the Protector of the righteous.",

4496,45,23,"Have you seen the one who took his whims as his god, and Allah caused him to stray despite having knowledge[6], and sealed up his hearing and heart, and put a cover over his sight? Who can guide him after Allah? Will you not then take heed?",[6] Or Allah’s eternal knowledge of that person's preference for his own inclinations over divine guidance.
4497,45,24,"And they say, “There is nothing but our life of this world: we die and we live[7], and nothing causes us to die except time.” They have no knowledge of that; they only speculate.","[7] i.e., some of us die without return, and others are born replacing them."
4498,45,25,"When Our clear verses are recited to them, their only argument is to say: “Bring our forefathers back, if you are truthful.”",

4522,46,12,"And before it was the Scripture of Moses a guide and a mercy. This Book is a confirmation of it, in the Arabic language, in order to warn those who do wrong and give glad tidings to those who do good.",

4525,46,15,"We have enjoined upon man kindness to his parents. His mother bore him in hardship and gave birth to him in hardship, and his bearing and weaning take thirty months, until when he reaches full maturity and reaches forty years, he says, “My Lord, inspire me to be grateful to Your favors which You blessed me and my parents with, and to do righteous deeds that will make You pleased; and make my offspring righteous. Indeed, I repent to you, and I am one of the Muslims [submitting to You].”",

Are you warning me that I will be resurrected, even though many generations have passed before me [yet none was resurrected]?” His parents cry seeking Allah’s help, “Woe to you! Believe!

4528,46,18,"Such are those upon whom the punishment has become binding, as happened to communities of Jinn and men before them, for they were truly losers.",
4529,46,19,"Everyone will be ranked according to what they did, so that He may recompense them in full for their deeds, and none will be wronged.",
4530,46,20,"On the Day when the disbelievers will be brought to the Fire, [they will be told], “You have exhausted your share of pleasures in the life of the world, and you have enjoyed them.

(See 46:22 of this chapter)."
4535,46,25,It will destroy everything by the command of its Lord. And they became such that there was nothing left visible except [ruins of] their dwellings. This is how We recompense the wicked people.,
4536,46,26,"We had given them the power to an extent that We have not given you [O Makkans], and We gave them[11] hearing, sight, and hearts. But neither their hearing, nor their sight, nor their hearts availed them in the least, for they used to reject the signs of Allah. And they were overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule.","[11] i.e., the people of Prophet Hūd."
4537,46,27,"We have certainly destroyed some towns around you and had given them numerous signs, so that they might return [from disbelief].",
4538,46,28,"Why is it that they were not helped by those [idols] whom they took as gods besides Allah so that they might bring them closer to Him[12]? Rather, they were lost from them. Such was [the outcome of] their falsehood and the lies they used to fabricate.",[12] As they used to claim.
4539,46,29,"And [remember] when We sent to you a group of jinn to listen to the Qur’an. When they heard it, they said [to one another], “Listen attentively.” Then when it was over, they returned to their people as warners.",
4540,46,30,"They said, “O our people, we have heard a scripture that has been sent down after Moses, confirming what came before it; it guides to the truth and to a straight path.",

4544,46,34,"On the Day when the disbelievers are exposed to the Fire, [they will be asked], “Is this not the truth?” They will say, “Yes indeed, by our Lord.” He will say, “Then taste the punishment for your disbelief.”",
4545,46,35,"So be patient, as the Messengers of Firm Resolve[15] were patient, and do not seek to hasten [punishment] for them. On the Day when they see what they were warned of, it will be as if they had only stayed [in this world] for an hour of a day[16]. This is a warning. Will anyone be destroyed except the rebellious people?","[15] They are Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon them all).

4546,47,1,"Those who disbelieve and prevent others from Allah’s way, He will render their deeds void.",
4547,47,2,"As for those who believe, do righteous deeds, and believe in what has been sent down to Muhammad – which is the truth from their Lord – He will absolve them of their sins and set their condition right.",
4548,47,3,"That is because the disbelievers follow falsehood, whereas the believers follow the truth from their Lord. This is how Allah explains to people their comparisons[1].",[1] So that each party may know the outcome of its choice.
4549,47,4,"When you encounter the disbelievers [in battle], strike [their] necks until you have thoroughly subdued them, then bind the captives firmly[2]. Later [you may free them] as a favor[3] or for ransom until the war comes to an end[4]. That [is Our command], if Allah had willed, He could have subjected them to punishment, but [He ordered you to fight] to test some of you by means of others. Those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never render their deeds void.","[2] i.e., seize those remaining fighters as captives.
 [3] i.e., release them without taking any ransom.

4550,47,5,"He will guide them, and will set their condition right,",
4551,47,6,"and He will admit them to Paradise, which He has already made known to them[5].",[5] The believers will recognize their mansions in Paradise just like they recognize their homes in the life of this world.

4553,47,8,"As for those who disbelieve, how wretched will be their state! And He will render their deeds void.",
4554,47,9,"That is because they detest what Allah has sent down, so He rendered their deeds worthless.",
4555,47,10,"Have they not traveled through the land to see what was the end of those before them? Allah destroyed them utterly[7], and a similar end awaits the disbelievers.","[7] i.e., Allah destroyed them and all their belongings of wealth, property, and offspring."
4556,47,11,That is because Allah is the Protector of the believers whereas the disbelievers have no protector.,
4557,47,12,"Allah will surely admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens under which rivers flow. As for those who disbelieve, they enjoy themselves [in this world] and they eat as cattle eat[8]; their final abode is the Fire.","[8] The disbelievers enjoy their life while they are oblivious of their consequences in the Hereafter, just like the cattle that graze in the pasture not knowing that they will probably be slaughtered soon."
4558,47,13,"How many towns We destroyed that were more powerful than your town that expelled you, and there was none to help them!",
4559,47,14,Are those who possess clear proof from their Lord like those whose evil deeds are made appealing to them and who follow their own desires?,
4560,47,15,"The likeness of Paradise promised to the righteous is that of a [garden which has] rivers of fresh water[9]; rivers of milk the taste of which never changes; rivers of wine delicious to drink; and rivers of pure honey.

Can they be like those who will abide in the Fire forever, and will be given boiling water to drink that tears apart their intestines?",[9] Neither stagnant nor polluted.
4561,47,16,"Among these [hypocrites] are some who listen to you [O Prophet], but when they leave your presence, they say to those who were given knowledge[10], “What did he just say[11]?” It is they whose hearts Allah has sealed up and who follow their desires.","[10] From among the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ).
 [11] In an ignoring and indifferent manner."
4562,47,17,"As for those who follow guidance, He increases them in guidance and blesses them with righteousness[12].","[12] Taqwā: It means piety, fear and consciousness of Allah, and care to avoid displeasing Him."
4563,47,18,Are they but waiting for the Hour to come upon them by surprise? Already [some of] its signs have appeared[13]. What good will it do them to take heed when it actually befalls them?,"[13] Such as the coming of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), and the splitting of the moon after the pagans of Makkah challenged the Prophet (ﷺ) which was fulfilled before their eyes, yet they denied that miracle."
4564,47,19,"Then know [O Prophet] that none has the right to be worshiped except Allah, and seek forgiveness for your sins[14] and for the [the sins of] the believing men and women, for Allah knows your movements and your places of rest.","[14] See footnote 40:55. Since the Prophet (ﷺ) is urged to seek forgiveness, the believers are far greater in need of seeking Allah’s forgiveness."
4565,47,20,"Those who believe say, “If only a Chapter were sent down [about fighting]? But when a precise Chapter is sent down and fighting[15] is mentioned therein, you see those in whose hearts is sickness looking at you like someone who is about to die. It would have been better for them[16]","[15] The believers longed for a Qur’anic revelation that would give them permission to fight their enemies.
 [16] It could also mean “Woe to them!” if disconnected from the next verse."
4566,47,21,"to obey and say good words. Once the fighting was ordained, it would be better for them to be truthful to Allah.",
4567,47,22,"Then if you turn away[17], what else can be expected but that you will spread corruption in the land and sever your ties of kinship[18]?","[17] From Islam or from struggling in the way of Allah.

4568,47,23,These are the ones whom Allah has cursed and has made them deaf and blinded their sight.,
4569,47,24,"Do they not reflect upon the Qur’an, or are there locks upon their hearts?",
4570,47,25,"Indeed, those who turn back [to disbelief] after guidance had become clear to them, it is Satan who has tempted them and deceived them with false hopes of a long life.",
4571,47,26,"That is because they say to those[19] who hate what Allah has sent down, “We will obey you in some matters[20].” But Allah knows their secret schemes.","[19] i.e., the Jews of Madīnah.

4572,47,27,"How will they feel when the angels take their souls, striking their faces and their backs?",
4573,47,28,"That is because they follow what incurs Allah’s wrath and they hate what pleases Him, so He will render their deeds worthless.",

4575,47,30,"If We willed, We could show them to you [O Prophet], so you would recognize them by their faces, but you will surely recognize them by the manner of their speech. And Allah knows all what you do.",

4581,47,36,"The life of this world is only play and amusement. But if you believe and fear Allah, He will give you your rewards, and He does not ask you for all your wealth[21].",[21] He only asks you for zakah (obligatory charity).
4582,47,37,"If He were to ask you for it[22] and insist that you give it, you would greedily withhold, and He would expose your resentment [for spending].","[22] i.e., all your wealth."
4583,47,38,"O you who are being called to spend in Allah’s way; among you are some who greedily withhold, but whoever withholds, he in fact withholds against himself, for Allah is the Self-Sufficient, whereas you are in need [of Him]. If you turn away, He will replace you with other people, then they will not be like you.",
4584,48,1,"Indeed, We have given you [O Prophet] a clear conquest[1],","[1] This surah takes its name ""Surah al-Fath"" (Surah of Conquest) from the clear conquest mentioned in this verse. This treaty was signed in 6 A.H./628 C.E. Ibn Mas‘ūd said, ""You [people] consider the conquest to be that of Makkah, but we consider it to be the Treaty of al-Hudaybiyyah."" Al-Barā’ bin ‘Āzib said something similar to this as reported by Al-Bukhāri. Although the companions initially regarded this treaty as a setback, yet in effect, it helped promote the spread of Islam, as thousands of people from different tribes accepted Islam during that truce. This treaty was in fact a precursor to the conquest of Makkah two years later."
4585,48,2,"so that Allah may forgive you your previous and future sins[2], complete His favor upon you, and guide you to a straight path,","[2] i.e., sins before this conquest and sins after it. See footnote 40:55, 47:19."
4586,48,3,and so that Allah may help you with a mighty victory.,
4587,48,4,"It is He Who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers so that they may increase in faith along with their faith. To Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and earth. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
4588,48,5,"So that He may admit the believing men and women to gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever, and absolve them of their sins; that is a supreme triumph before Allah.",
4589,48,6,"And so that He may punish hypocrite men and women and polytheist men and women, who harbor about Allah evil thoughts[3]. An evil fate will befall them. Allah is angry with them and has cursed them and prepared for them Hell. What a terrible destination!","[3] i.e., that Allah will not support His religion and His Prophet (ﷺ) and that the believers will end up with misfortune and defeat."
4590,48,7,"To Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and earth, and Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.",
4591,48,8,"Indeed, We have sent you [O prophet] as a witness, a bearer of glad tidings, and a warner,",

4593,48,10,"Those who pledge allegiance to you [O Prophet] are indeed pledging allegiance to Allah; Allah’s Hand is over their hands[4]. Whoever breaks his pledge, he only breaks it to his own detriment, but whoever fulfills his covenant with Allah, He will give him a great reward.","[4] i.e., Allah Almighty approved their pledge."
4594,48,11,"Those of the Bedouins who lagged behind will say to you, “We were preoccupied with our wealth and our families, so ask for forgiveness for us.” They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say, “Then who can prevent Allah if He intends to harm or benefit you? Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",
4595,48,12,"But you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families ever, and that was made appealing in your hearts. You harbored evil thoughts, for you are a doomed people.”",

Say, “You will never follow us; this is what Allah has already decreed.” They will then say, “Rather, you are jealous of us[6].” Rather, they do not understand but a little[7].","[5] Allah promised those of the believers who pledged allegiance at Hudaybiyah that the spoils of war obtained from the Jews of Khaybar be exclusively for them.
 [6] i.e., you only ask us not to go with you to the spoils of Khsybar to deprive us of our share.
 [7] i.e., they do not understand but the material aspects of life."
4599,48,16,"Say to the Bedouins who lagged behind, “You will be called against a people of great might[8], whom you will fight unless they submit[9]. Then if you obey, Allah will give you a goodly reward, but if you turn away as you turned away before, He will afflict you with a painful punishment.","[8] Referring to the two pagan Arab tribes: Hawāzin and Thaqīf.

4600,48,17,"There is no blame on the blind, nor on the lame, nor on the sick [for remaining behind]. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him into gardens under which rivers flow. But whoever turns away, He will afflict him with a painful punishment.",
4601,48,18,"Allah was much pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you [O Prophet] under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquility upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest[10],","[10] The conquest of Khaybar occurred in 7 A.H./628 C.E, which preceded that of Makkah."
4602,48,19,"and abundant spoils of war they will gain. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.",
4603,48,20,"Allah has promised you abundant spoils of war that you will gain, and He has hastened for you this [conquest][11], and He has restrained people’s hands from you, so that it may be a sign for the believers, and so that He may guide you to a straight path.","[11] i.e., the spoils of Khaybar."
4604,48,21,"And there are other [spoils] that you have not yet been able to gain, but Allah has full control over them[12], for Allah is Most Capable of all things.","[12] i.e., Allah has prepared or decreed them for you."
4605,48,22,"If the disbelievers were to fight you, they would surely turn their backs, then they would not have any protector or helper.",
4606,48,23,"Such was the way of Allah in the past, and you will not find any change in Allah’s way.",
4607,48,24,"It is He Who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them near Makkah[13], after giving you the upper hand over them. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.","[13] A group of pagans of Makkah who were around eighty people came to attack the Muslims in Hudaybiyyah on their way to Makkah, but Muslims were able to take them as captives, then released them."
4608,48,25,"It is they who disbelieved and prevented you from the Sacred Mosque and detained the sacrificial animals[14] from reaching their place of sacrifice. If it had not been for the believing men and women whom you could not identify, you might have trampled over them, thus incurring guilt unknowingly, [We would have let you march to Makkah]. [This was] so that Allah may admit to His mercy whom He wills[15]. If they had been distinct [from the disbelievers], We would surely have inflicted on those who disbelieved among them a painful punishment.","[14] i.e., The Prophet (ﷺ) had brought along with him seventy camels to be sacrificed after completing the rituals of ‘Umrah (the minor pilgrimage).
 [15] Thus, not only the Muslims in Makkah who were not known to their fellow believers were safe, but also those pagans who later embraced Islam were safe too."
4609,48,26,"When the disbelievers harbored pride in their hearts – the pride of ignorance[16] – then Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and caused them to adhere to the word of piety[17], for they were more deserving and worthy of it. And Allah is All-Knowing of everything.","[16] This was when the pagans of Makkah prevented the Prophet (ﷺ) and the believers from entering the Sacred House to perform ‘Umrah for fear that Arabs would consider this a shame and insult to the pagans for allowing Muslims to enter Makkah.
 [17] That none has the right to be worshiped except Allan, and that Muhammad is His messenger (declaration of faith)."
4610,48,27,"Indeed, Allah has fulfilled His Messenger’s dream in truth: that you will surely enter the Sacred Mosque if Allah wills, in peace and safety, and you will have your heads shaved or shortened[18], without any fear. He knew what you did not know, and He granted you prior to that an imminent conquest[19].","[18] Shaving or trimming hair is from the requirements upon completing the rites of pilgrimage.
 [19] Referring to the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah and subsequently the conquest of Khaybar prior to the fulfillment of the Prophet’s dream regarding entering Makkah for pilgrimage."
4611,48,28,"It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, to make it prevail over all religions, and sufficient is Allah as a Witness.",
4612,48,29,"Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are firm against the disbelievers[20] and compassionate among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking Allah’s grace and pleasure. Their distinguishing sign is on their faces from the effects of prostration. Such is their description in the Torah[21]. And their description in the Gospel is like that of a seed that sprouts its shoot, then makes it strong; then it grows thick and stands straight on its stem[22], which delights the sowers – so that He may enrage thereby the disbelievers. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness and a great reward.","[20] It should be understood in its historical context. Muslims are urged here to be firm with the Arab disbelievers who were at war with Muslims. However, Muslims are encouraged to treat peaceful and non-combatant disbelievers with kindness and fairness. See 60:8-9.
 [21] The description of the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions is mentioned in the previous scriptures. See Deuteronomy 33:1-3. [22] See Matthew 13:3-9, Mark 4:26-28."
4613,49,1,"O you who believe, do not decide [any matter of importance] before Allah and His Messenger[1], and fear Allah, for Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",[1] Show complete obedience to Allah and the Prophet (ﷺ).
4614,49,2,"O you who believe, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor speak loudly to him as you speak loudly to one another[2], lest your deeds become worthless without you realizing it.","[2] Or do not call him by his name as you call one another; do not call him, ‘O Muhammad.’ rather, call him, ‘O Prophet.’"
4615,49,3,"Indeed, those who lower their voices in the presence of the Messenger of Allah are those whose hearts Allah has tested for righteousness; for them there is forgiveness and a great reward[3].",[3] Once the Prophet (ﷺ) was taking a nap in the afternoon when a group of people from the tribe of Bani Tamīm came to see him. They started calling him out loud while standing outside the chambers of his wives.
4616,49,4,"As for those who call out to you [O Prophet] from behind the chambers, most of them have no understanding.",
4617,49,5,"If they had been patient until you came out to them, it would have been better for them. But Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
4618,49,6,"O you who believe, if an evildoer brings you some news, verify it, lest you harm a people unknowingly, then you become regretful for what you did[4].","[4] The Prophet (ﷺ) sent Al-Walīd ibn ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu‘ait to collect zakah (alms-tax) from the tribe of Bani Al-Mustaliq. They went out to receive Al-Walīd but he thought that they wanted to harm him. So, he quickly came back to the Prophet (ﷺ) with the bad news, so he wanted to punish them. After a while, a delegation from Bani Al-Mustaliq came to clear the misunderstanding."
4619,49,7,"Know that the Messenger of Allah is among you. If he were to obey you in many matters, you would surely suffer[5]. But Allah has endeared faith to you and made it pleasing to your hearts, and has made disbelief, wickedness, and disobedience hateful to you. Such are the rightly guided,",[5] Things would be difficult for you.

Do not speak ill of one another, nor call one another by [offensive] nicknames. How evil is the name of wickedness after having faith! And whoever does not repent, it is they who are the wrongdoers.",
4624,49,12,"O you who believe, avoid much suspicion, for some suspicions are sin. Do not spy on one another, nor backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother[6]? You would surely abhor it. So fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Accepting of Repentance, Most Merciful.","[6] Backbiting people is likened to eating their dead bodies, for the dead do not feel the pain if their flesh is eaten; likewise, the one who is absent does not feel the pain of backbiting. So, backbiting someone is like eating his flesh while he is dead."
4625,49,13,"O people, We have created you from a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes so that you may recognize one another. Indeed, the most noble of you before Allah is the most righteous[7] among you. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.","[7] Lit., ""the one who has the most taqwā among you,"" i.e., consciousness, piety, and fear of Allah."
4626,49,14,"The Bedouins say, “We have believed.” Say, “You have not believed, but say, ‘We have submitted,’ for faith has not yet entered your hearts[8]. But if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not detract anything from the reward of your deeds. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”","[8] There is a distinction between Islam and Imān (faith). Imān is a higher degree than Islam. This distinction is mentioned in an authentic Hadīth of the Prophet (ﷺ), known as the Hadīth of Gabriel."

4700,51,25,"When they came to him and said, “Peace.” He said, “Upon you be peace.” [saying to himself] “Unknown people!”",
4701,51,26,"Then he went quickly to his household, and came with a fat [roasted] calf,",
4702,51,27,"and placed it before them and said, “Will you not eat?”",
4703,51,28,"He felt apprehensive about them[7]. They said, “Do not be afraid,” and gave him glad tidings of a knowledgeable son.","[7] In their culture, if a guest refused to eat the food provided, it was considered a sign of ill will. See footnote 11:70."
4704,51,29,"His wife cried out loud, and struck her face [in astonishment] and said, “[I am] a barren old woman!”",
4705,51,30,"They said, “This is what your Lord said. Indeed, He is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing.”",
4706,51,31,"Abraham said, “Then what is your mission, O messengers?”",
4707,51,32,"They said, “We have been sent to a wicked people,",
4708,51,33,"to send down upon them stones of clay,",
4709,51,34,marked by your Lord for the transgressors.”,
4710,51,35,"We brought out those believers who were there,",
4711,51,36,but We only found in it one Muslim household[8].,[8] Lot's family except his wife.
4712,51,37,And We left there a sign[9] for those who fear the painful punishment.,"[9] i.e., the ruins of Sodom or the Dead Sea in Palestine, as a lesson for people."
4713,51,38,"And [there is a sign in the story of] Moses when We sent him to Pharaoh with compelling proofs,",
4714,51,39,"But he and his supporters turned away, and he said about [Moses], “A magician or a madman!”",
4715,51,40,So We seized him and his soldiers and cast them into the sea while he was blameworthy[10].,[10] For his disbelief and arrogance.
4716,51,41,"And [there is a sign in the story of] ‘Ād, when We sent against them the devastating barren wind[11].",[11] Devoid of all goodness such as carrying rain or fertilizing trees.
4717,51,42,It spared nothing it came upon except that it reduced it to ruin and decay.,
4718,51,43,"And [there is a sign in the story of] Thamūd, when they were told, “Enjoy yourselves for a while[12].”","[12] i.e., only three days. See 11:65."

4721,51,46,And the people of Noah [were also destroyed] before them. They were indeed a rebellious people.,
4722,51,47,"We built the heaven with might[13], and We are indeed expanding it.","[13] ’Ayd does not mean ""hands"" here. This is not from the verses of Allah's attributes, for Allah Almighty did not add it to Himself, i.e., He did not say, ""My ’ayd, or Our ’ayd""."

4727,51,52,"Likewise, no messenger came to those before them without being told: “A magician, or a madman!”",
4728,51,53,Did they suggest this to one another[17]? Rather they are transgressing people.,"[17] i.e., Did the previous disbelievers pass on these false allegations to the pagans of Makkah so they repeat their words?"
4729,51,54,"So turn away from them [O Prophet], for you are not to blame[18].",[18] After you have delivered the message.

As for the Hereafter, suffering patiently in Hell will not bring any reward or benefit."

4764,52,29,"So keep exhorting [O Prophet], for you are not, by the grace of your Lord, a soothsayer or a madman.",

4790,53,6,"and of great perfection[2], who manifested himself [in his true form][3]","[2] i.e., the strength of body and mind.
 [3] Archangel Gabriel appeared to the Prophet (ﷺ) only twice in his angelic form: once at the outset of the Prophet’s mission (as he manifested himself, filling the horizon, so the Prophet (ﷺ) lost his consciousness), and another time during the Prophet’s ascension to the seventh heaven where he directly received from Allah the order to pray five times a day. See 17:1."
4791,53,7,when he was on the higher horizon[4].,"[4] i.e., above the eastern horizon in the sky where the sun rises."
4792,53,8,"Then he approached [the Prophet] and descended,",
4793,53,9,until he was only two bow-lengths away or even closer.,

4795,53,11,The [Prophet’s] heart[6] did not deny what he saw.,"[6] i.e., his mind or perception."
4796,53,12,Do you dispute with him concerning what he saw?,
4797,53,13,He certainly saw him a second time[7],"[7] i.e., During his ascent (al-Mi‘rāj) to the heavens, he saw Gabriel in his true angelic form."

4804,53,20,"and Manāt, the third one as well[8]?",[8] These were three well-known idols or goddesses worshiped by Arab pagans before the advent of Islam.
4805,53,21,Do you choose for yourselves males and for Him females?,
4806,53,22,That is then an unfair division!,

4808,53,24,Is it that man can get whatever he wishes for[10]?,[10] The pagans worshiped these idols wishing that they would intercede for them on the Day of Resurrection. See 39:3.

The moon was split as they requested and then re-joined, and the incident was reported by several eyewitnesses in different parts of the land; however, they still refused to believe, considering it magic."

Moses (عليه السلام) was given the miracles of staff and a bright hand. Jesus (عليه السلام) would give life to the dead and heal the blind and the leper. Muhammad (ﷺ) was given the Qur’an, a literary miracle, challenging the masters of Arabic eloquence. Nonetheless, he (ﷺ) performed other miracles such as splitting the moon, increasing food and water, and healing some ailments."

4879,54,33,The people of Lot rejected the warnings.,
4880,54,34,"We sent against them a storm of pebbles, except the family of Lot whom We saved before dawn,",

5512,74,17,I will subject him to an unbearable punishment.,

This is but a reminder to mankind.","[8] To say what they want to say, so their punishment will be multiplied for them. Abu Jahl, one of the chief pagans in Makkah, made fun of the Prophet (ﷺ) when they came to know that the keepers of Hell are nineteen angels, so he ridiculed this number and said that it is an easy number to overcome."

5638,77,16,Did We not destroy the earlier nations?,
5639,77,17,Then We will do likewise to the later ones.,
5640,77,18,This is how We deal with the wicked.,
5641,77,19,Woe on that Day to the deniers!,
5642,77,20,"Did We not create you from a worthless fluid,",
5643,77,21,then We placed it in a secure repository,
5644,77,22,for a determined period[4]?,[4] See 23:12-14
5645,77,23,For We determined it; How excellently We determine!,
5646,77,24,Woe on that Day to the deniers!,

5648,77,26,"for the living and the dead,",
5649,77,27,"and placed therein firm towering mountains, and given you fresh water to drink?",

5679,78,7,"And the mountains as stakes[3],","[3] Mountains go deep below the surface like pegs and icebergs, stabilizing the earth and slowing tectonic movement."
5680,78,8,"and created you in pairs,",

5692,78,20,"and the mountains will vanish, becoming like a mirage.",

5696,78,24,"They will neither taste therein any coolness nor any drink,",
5697,78,25,"except for scalding water and discharge of wounds,",

5699,78,27,"Indeed, they did not expect a reckoning,",
5700,78,28,and utterly rejected Our verses.,
5701,78,29,But We have enumerated everything in a record[6].,"[6] i.e., a record of deeds."
5702,78,30,"So taste [the punishment], for We will not increase you except in torment[7].”",[7] The addressees are the dwellers of Hell.

5704,78,32,"gardens and vineyards,",
5705,78,33,"and full-bosomed maidens of equal age,",
5706,78,34,and a full cup [of wine][9].,"[9] i.e., tasteful wine which neither intoxicates nor causes headache."
5707,78,35,They will not hear therein vain talk or lies –,
5708,78,36,"a reward and a generous gift from your Lord[10],","[10] Or ""a gift adequately calculated""; as a result of their righteous deeds as well as the ample generosity of Allah."
5709,78,37,"[from] the Lord of the heavens and earth and all that is between them, the Most Compassionate; none will dare to speak to Him[11].",[11] None can ask or plead on the Day of Judgment except by Allah's permission.
5710,78,38,"On the Day when the Spirit and the angels will stand in rows; none will dare to speak, except those to whom the Most Compassionate granted permission, and they will only speak the truth.",
5711,78,39,That Day is sure to come. So whoever wills may seek a path leading to his Lord[12].,"[12] i.e., the path of guidance and righteous deeds."
5712,78,40,"Indeed, We have warned you of an imminent punishment on the Day when everyone will see what his hands have sent forth[13], and the disbeliever will say, “Oh, I wish that I were dust!”","[13] i.e., the deeds he did in this world."
5713,79,1,"By those who pull out [evil souls][1] harshly,",[1] Of the disbelievers.
5714,79,2,"and by those who draw out [good souls][2] gently,",[2] Of the believers.
5715,79,3,"and by those who glide swiftly[3],","[3] i.e., angels glide swiftly through the heavens and earth with Allah’s command."
5716,79,4,"and those who overtake one another as in a race[4],",[4] To execute Allah's commands.
5717,79,5,"and those who carry out the command [of Allah],",
5718,79,6,"on the Day when the earth convulses [by the first Blast],",
5719,79,7,"followed by the second Blast,",
5720,79,8,"hearts[5] will be pounding on that Day,",[5] Of those who denied the Resurrection.
5721,79,9,and their eyes[6] will be downcast.,[6] Of the disbelievers.
5722,79,10,"They say, “Will we be brought back to life,",
5723,79,11,after we have turned into decayed bones[7]?”,[7] They would say this in ridicule of the warning.
5724,79,12,"They say, “Then that would surely be a losing return[8]!”",[8] To one another.
5725,79,13,"It will only be a single Blast,",
5726,79,14,then they will immediately be above the ground.,
5727,79,15,"Has there come to you the story of Moses,",
5728,79,16,when his Lord called out to him at the sacred valley of Tuwa?,
5729,79,17,"[Saying,] “Go to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed all bounds”.",
5730,79,18,"And say: ‘Are you willing to be purified,",
5731,79,19,and I will guide you to your Lord so that you may fear Him?’”,
5732,79,20,Then Moses showed him the greatest sign[9].,"[9] i.e., the miracle of the staff turning into a snake. See 20:17-23."
5733,79,21,But Pharaoh denied it and disobeyed.,
5734,79,22,Then he turned back striving to plot.,
5735,79,23,"He gathered [his people] and proclaimed,",
5736,79,24,"saying, “I am your lord, the most high.”",
5737,79,25,So Allah seized him for an exemplary punishment in this life and in the Hereafter[10].,[10] Or for his claim of being the greatest god and for his previous oppression of the Children of Israel.
5738,79,26,"Indeed, there is a lesson in this for those who fear Allah.",
5739,79,27,Are you more difficult to create or the heaven that He built?,
5740,79,28,"He raised its vault high and proportioned it,",
5741,79,29,and darkened its night and brought forth its daylight.,
5742,79,30,"And thereafter He spread out the earth,",
5743,79,31,"brought forth from it its water and its pasture,",
5744,79,32,"and set the mountains firmly,",
5745,79,33,as a provision for you and your grazing livestock.,
5746,79,34,"But when the Supreme Calamity comes[11],","[11] i.e., the second Blast which marks the Day of judgment."
5747,79,35,"on that Day man will remember all what he did,",
5748,79,36,and the Blazing Fire will be exposed for all to see.,
5749,79,37,"As for those who transgressed,",
5750,79,38,"and preferred the life of this world,",
5751,79,39,the Blazing Fire will be their abode.,
5752,79,40,"But those who feared standing before their Lord and restrained themselves from evil desires,",
5753,79,41,Paradise will surely be their abode.,
5754,79,42,"They ask you concerning the Hour, “When will it be[12]?”","[12] Lit., ""established."""
5755,79,43,How could you possibly mention that?,
5756,79,44,Its knowledge rests only with your Lord[13].,"[13] i.e., its end and termination. Its ultimate knowledge belongs to Allah alone."
5757,79,45,You are only a warner for those who fear it.,
5758,79,46,"On the Day when they see it[14], it will be as if they had remained [in this world] no more than an evening or a morning.","[14] i.e., the Hour."
5759,80,1,"He frowned and turned away,",
5760,80,2,when the blind man came to him[1].,"[1] Abdullah ibn Um Maktūm, an early Muslim who was blind, came to the Prophet (ﷺ) seeking to learn, while the Prophet (ﷺ) was in the middle of a discussion with a leading pagan of Makkah, calling him to Islam. Abdullah was so impatient that he interrupted their discussion. The Prophet (ﷺ) frowned and turned his attention to that pagan. So this Makkan surah was revealed, telling the Prophet (ﷺ) that the faithful blind man was more worthy of attention than that disbeliever."
5761,80,3,"How would you know? Perhaps he might be purified[2],",[2] Through the knowledge he learns from you.
5762,80,4,or he might take heed and benefit from the reminder?,
5763,80,5,"But he who was indifferent[3],",[3] Towards faith. Here it is referring to that influential pagan of the Quraysh whom the Prophet (ﷺ) had hoped to embrace Islam.
5764,80,6,"you give him your full attention,",
5765,80,7,although you are not to be blamed if he does not purify himself[4].,"[4] The Prophets are only responsible to convey the message, not for people’s guidance."
5766,80,8,"But as for the one who came to you striving [for purification],",
5767,80,9,"and he fears Allah,",
5768,80,10,you let yourself be distracted from him.,
5769,80,11,No indeed; this is a reminder –,
5770,80,12,so whoever wills may give heed to it –,
5771,80,13,"on venerable pages,",
5772,80,14,"exalted and purified,",
5773,80,15,"[preserved] in the hands of angel-scribes,",
5774,80,16,honorable and obedient.,
5775,80,17,Woe to man; how ungrateful he is[5]!,"[5] i.e., the disbelievers."
5776,80,18,From what did He create him?,
5777,80,19,"He created him from a drop of semen and proportioned him[6],","[6] His creation, provisions, life span, etc."
5778,80,20,then He made the way easy for him[7];,"[7] i.e., the way out of his mothers’ wombs (his birth), or the way to guidance."
5779,80,21,then He caused him to die and be buried;,
5780,80,22,"then when He wills, He will resurrect him.",
5781,80,23,Yet he has not fulfilled what He commanded him.,
5782,80,24,Let man consider the food he eats:,
5783,80,25,"How We pour down rainwater in torrents,",
5784,80,26,"and cause the soil to split open [for sprouts],",
5785,80,27,"and cause grains to grow in it,",
5786,80,28,"as well as grapes and fodder,",
5787,80,29,"and olive trees and date palms,",
5788,80,30,"and dense orchards,",
5789,80,31,"and fruits and grass,",
5790,80,32,as provision for you and your livestock.,
5791,80,33,"But when the Deafening Blast[8] comes,",[8] The piercing Blast; the second Blast for resurrection.
5792,80,34,"on that Day everyone will flee from his brother,",
5793,80,35,"and from his mother and father,",
5794,80,36,and from his wife and children.,
5795,80,37,"On that day, everyone will have enough concern of his own[9].",[9] Thus forgetting all others.
5796,80,38,"On that Day, some faces will be bright,",
5797,80,39,cheerful and rejoicing;,
5798,80,40,"while other faces will be dust-stained,",
5799,80,41,covered in darkness.,
5800,80,42,"Such are the disbelievers, the wicked.",
5801,81,1,"When the sun is wrapped up in darkness,",
5802,81,2,"and when the stars fall down,",
5803,81,3,"and when the mountains are set in motion,",
5804,81,4,"and when pregnant camels[1] are left unattended,","[1] Which are near delivery. It alludes to the distraction of people from their most valuable possessions, such as ten-month pregnant camels for nomadic Arabs."
5805,81,5,"and when wild beasts are gathered,",
5806,81,6,"and when the seas are set on fire,",
5807,81,7,"and when the souls are sorted[2],","[2] i.e., ""joined"" with their groups or sects, wicked with the wicked souls, righteous with the righteous."
5808,81,8,"and when the baby girl buried alive[3] is asked,",[3] As the pagan Arabs used to do for fear of shame or poverty. The Qur’an condemned this practice. See 16:58-59.
5809,81,9,"for what crime she was killed,",
5810,81,10,"and when records of deeds are spread open,",
5811,81,11,"and when the sky is stripped away[4],",[4] As the skin of sheep is stripped away.
5812,81,12,"and when the Blazing Fire is flared up,",
5813,81,13,and when Paradise is brought near –,
5814,81,14,then every soul will know what it has brought about[5].,"[5] Of faith or disbelief, good or bad deeds for that Day."
5815,81,15,"I swear by the receding stars,",
5816,81,16,"that rise and hide[6],","[6] This probably refers to black holes in the sky. ""Kanasa"" means sweeping or hiding."
5817,81,17,"and by the night as it departs,",
5818,81,18,and by the day as it breaks –,
5819,81,19,"Indeed, this [Qur’an] is a word conveyed by a noble angel-messenger.",
5820,81,20,"extremely powerful, highly revered by the Lord of the Throne,",
5821,81,21,obeyed there [by other angels] and trustworthy.,
5822,81,22,"Your fellow [i.e., the Prophet] is not a madman.",
5823,81,23,"He indeed saw him [i.e., Gabriel] on the clear horizon[7].","[7] i.e., the eastern horizon, where the sun rises. See footnote 53:6"
5824,81,24,He does not withhold [knowledge of] the unseen[8].,[8] He (ﷺ) did not withhold the unseen which Allah had revealed to him in the Qur’an.
5825,81,25,This [Qur’an] is not the word of an accursed devil.,
5826,81,26,So which way are you going[9]?,[9] In your denial of the Qur’an for being the revelation from Allah.
5827,81,27,"It is but a reminder to the worlds,",
5828,81,28,for those among you who wish to take the straight path.,
5829,81,29,"But you cannot wish except by the Will of Allah, the Lord of the worlds.",
5830,82,1,When the sky breaks apart.,
5831,82,2,"and when the stars fall, scattered,",
5832,82,3,"and when the seas burst forth,",
5833,82,4,"and when the graves are overturned,",
5834,82,5,then each soul will come to know what it has done or what it has left undone.,
5835,82,6,"O mankind, what has lured you away from your Lord, the Most Generous,",
5836,82,7,"Who created you, then shaped and proportioned you,",
5837,82,8,and assembled you in whatever form He willed?,
5838,82,9,"No indeed; but you deny the Judgment Day,",
5839,82,10,"while there are watchers[1] over you,","[1] i.e., angels who preserve all your deeds."
5840,82,11,"honorable scribes,",
5841,82,12,who know whatever you do.,
5842,82,13,"Indeed, the righteous will be in Bliss,",
5843,82,14,"and the wicked will be in Blazing Fire,",
5844,82,15,"which they will enter on Judgment Day,",
5845,82,16,and will never come out of it.,
5846,82,17,How do you know what Judgment Day is?,
5847,82,18,"Again, how do you know what Judgment Day is?",
5848,82,19,"It is the Day when no soul will be of any help to another, and all command on that Day will be with Allah.",
5849,83,1,"Woe to the defrauders[1],","[1] i.e., those who cheat people by giving them less in sale transactions, an amount so little as to hardly be noticed."
5850,83,2,"those who take full measure when they take from others,",
5851,83,3,but they give less when they measure or weigh for them.,
5852,83,4,Do they really not think that they will be resurrected,
5853,83,5,"for a momentous Day,",
5854,83,6,a Day when people will stand before the Lord of the worlds?,
5855,83,7,No indeed! The record of the wicked is surely in Sijjīn.,
5856,83,8,How do you know what Sijjīn is?,
5857,83,9,It is a clearly inscribed Record.,
5858,83,10,"Woe on that Day to the deniers,",
5859,83,11,those who deny the Judgment Day!,
5860,83,12,None denies it except every sinful transgressor.,
5861,83,13,"When Our verses are recited to him, he says, “Ancient fables[2]!”","[2] i.e., tales of old times, legends of former peoples."
5862,83,14,No indeed! Their hearts have been stained by what they used to commit[3]!,"[3] i.e., their sins and evil deeds."
5863,83,15,No indeed! On that Day they will be barred from seeing their Lord[4].,"[4] As a punishment, since the believers will see Him."
5864,83,16,"They will then surely enter the Blazing Fire,",
5865,83,17,"then they will be told, “This is what you used to deny.”",
5866,83,18,No indeed! The record of the righteous is certainly in ‘illiyyīn –,
5867,83,19,and how do you know what ‘illiyyūn is? –,
5868,83,20,"It is a record inscribed,",
5869,83,21,witnessed by those who are close to Allah.,

5876,83,28,a spring from which those who are close to Allah will drink.,
5877,83,29,"Indeed, the wicked used to laugh at the believers;",
5878,83,30,"when they passed by them, they would wink at one another,",

5880,83,32,"When they saw the believers, they would say, “These people are truly misguided,”",
5881,83,33,although they were not sent as their keepers.,

5883,83,35,"while sitting on the couches, gazing around.",
5884,83,36,Have the disbelievers been rewarded except for what they used to do?,

5902,84,18,"and by the moon when it becomes full,",

5906,84,22,"Rather, the disbelievers persist in denying it,",
5907,84,23,but Allah knows best whatever they harbor in their hearts.,
5908,84,24,So give them the tidings of a painful punishment.,

5916,85,7,and were witnessing what they did to the believers[2].,"[2] After the believers were casted into a trench of fire, they sat around it watching them burn to death. It occurred long before Prophet Muhammad's (ﷺ) time."
5917,85,8,"Their only grievance against them was that they believed in Allah, the All-Mighty, the Praiseworthy,",

5935,86,4,there is no soul except that there is a watcher over it.,
5936,86,5,Let man reflect on what he was created from.,
5937,86,6,"He was created from a spurting fluid,",
5938,86,7,emerging from between the backbone and the ribs[2].,[2] Both testes and ovaries are sustained by arteries originating between the backbone and the ribcage.
5939,86,8,"Indeed, Allah is able to bring him back to life.",

5964,87,16,"But you prefer the life of this world,",
5965,87,17,even though the Hereafter is better and more lasting.,

5969,88,2,"On that Day, some faces will be humiliated,",

5987,88,20,"and the earth, how it is spread out?",
5988,88,21,So remind [O Prophet]; your duty is only to remind;,
5989,88,22,you are not assigned to compel them.,
5990,88,23,"But whoever turns away and disbelieves,",
5991,88,24,Allah will inflict upon him the greatest punishment[3].,"[3] i.e., the greatest punishment is the Hellfire. The minor punishment includes disasters in worldly life and grave punishment."
5992,88,25,"Indeed, to Us is their return,",
5993,88,26,then it is for Us to call them to account.,

5997,89,4,"and by the night when it comes,",
5998,89,5,are these oaths not sufficient for those who have sense?,
5999,89,6,Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with ‘Ād,
6000,89,7,"of Iram[3], who were people of great stature,","[3] Iram: an ancient tribe; or a well-known tribe in Yemen; or the grandfather of the people of ‘Aad, etc. Prophet Hūd was sent to the people of ‘Aad."

6002,89,9,"and Thamūd, who carved out the rocks in the Valley;",

6004,89,11,"All of them transgressed in the land,",
6005,89,12,"and spread therein much corruption,",
6006,89,13,so your Lord poured upon them a scourge of punishment.,

6008,89,15,"As for man, when he is tested by his Lord by honoring him and bestowing blessings upon him, he says, “My Lord has [deservedly] honored me[5]!”","[5] Instead of being grateful, he is proud, attributing the favor to his own merit."
6009,89,16,"But when he is tested by restricting his provision, he says, “My Lord has [undeservedly] humiliated me!”",
6010,89,17,"No indeed[6]! You are not kind to the orphan,",[6] It is not as you think. Allah puts people to test through prosperity and hardship and rewards their gratitude and patience in the Hereafter.

6017,89,24,"He will say, “Would that I had sent forth something for my [eternal] life!”",
6018,89,25,"None can punish as He punishes on that Day,",

6034,90,11,"Yet he did not make his way through the steep path[3],",[3] He did not spend for the sake of Allah but to show off.
6035,90,12,and how do you know what the steep path is?,
6036,90,13,"It is freeing a slave,",
6037,90,14,"or giving food on a day of hunger,",
6038,90,15,"to an orphan relative,",
6039,90,16,"or to a needy person in misery,",
6040,90,17,then [most importantly] to be one of those who believe and exhort one another to patience and exhort one another to compassion.,
6041,90,18,Such are the people of the Right[4].,"[4] i.e., those who receive the records of their deeds in the right hand and proceed to Paradise."

6064,92,6,"and truly believes in the best reward,",
6065,92,7,We will make easy for him the way of salvation.,
6066,92,8,"But as for the one who is miserly and deems himself self-sufficient,",

6092,94,2,and relieved you of your burden[2],"[2] forgave your previous or future errors, or relieved you of the anxiety you experienced at the beginning of your mission."
6093,94,3,"that weighed down your back,",
6094,94,4,and raised high your fame for you[3]?,"[3] Allah raised the Prophet's name in numerous ways, such as his name is mentioned twice in the call to prayer five times a day, as well the second call to prayer; at the end of each of the five daily prayers; believers invoke Allah’s blessings upon him and his family; and upon reverting to Islam, his name is mentioned, etc."
6095,94,5,"For indeed, with hardship comes ease[4],","[4] In Arabic grammar, if a definite noun is repeated, it is referring to the same thing. However, if an indefinite noun is repeated, it is referring to two different things. So here in this and the coming verse they refer to one hardship (a definite noun) and two eases (an indefinite noun), which manifests Allah's favors upon His servants even in times of hardships."
6096,94,6,"indeed, with hardship comes ease.",

There is a similar reference in Deuteronomy 33:1, [Moses said:] “The Lord came from Sinai. Rising from Seir upon us, and he shone forth from Mount Paran.” Seir is a mountain near Jerusalem, and Paran is a mountain near Makkah."
6102,95,4,"Surely We have created man in the best form[4],","[4] i.e., in upright and balanced form and nature."

6111,96,5,taught man what he did not know[1].,"[1] These five verses (1-5) are the first ever verses revealed of the Qur’an. The Prophet (ﷺ) was retreating at a cave in the outskirts of Makkah when the angel Gabriel appeared before him, and ordered him to read. Since the Prophet (ﷺ) was unlettered, he would respond, “I cannot read.” Gabriel would then squeeze him tightly and order him again to read. Ultimately, Gabriel said to him: “Read in the name of your Lord …”."

6116,96,10,a slave [of Allah] from praying[3]?,[3] Abu Jahl abused the Prophet (ﷺ) when he prayed in the Holy Mosque.
6117,96,11,"What if this [slave] is rightly guided,",
6118,96,12,and enjoins righteousness?,
